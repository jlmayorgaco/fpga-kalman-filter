	abstract = {With the rapid development of science and technology,the coal mine boom-type roadheader is developing towards the direction of automation, fewer people, and more intelligence. The formation of roadway sections is the main task of the boom-type roadheader. A non-singular terminal sliding mode control method based on an unknown dynamic estimator (UDE) is proposed aiming at the trajectory control of the cutting head for the coal mine tunneling robot,which is affected by unknown external disturbance,system nonlinearity,and parametric uncertainty. Firstly,considering the hydraulic driving system,a 3-order nonlinear strict feedback state-space model of the roadheader cutting electro-hydraulic driving system is established. Secondly,a super spiral sliding mode differentiator with finite time state convergence is used to estimate the unknown speed state of the system. The UDE is designed based on a low-pass filter to estimate the lumped uncertainty of the unmatched items of the system,and a fast terminal sliding mode control law is designed using a nonsingular terminal sliding mode surface and a power exponential reaching law. Real-time feedforward compensation for the system disturbances observed by the UDE can effectively alleviate the controller chattering problem existing in traditional sliding mode control. At the same time,in order to reduce the computational complexity of derivatives of high-order virtual control variables, the command filtering technology is introduced, and high gain robust feedback is used to suppress the disturbance of system matching terms. The stability of the closed-loop system is proved by using the Lyapunov synthesis method. Finally, the prototype of the tunneling robot is utilized to carry out experimental verification. The experimental results show that when tracking step signals,0.1 Hz sinusoidal signals,and mixed frequency signals,the average value of the tracking error of the proposed control method is reduced by 61.60%,66.51%,and 66.27% respectively compared with the traditional PI control. And the root mean square value of the tracking error is reduced by 54.00%,64.53%,and 61.90% respectively. The algorithm can effectively suppress the multi-source uncertainty disturbance of the system,and realize the high-precision position control and dynamic fast response of the cutting system of the roadheader robot. © 2023 China Coal Society.

	abstract = {Several controllers address Load Frequency Control (LFC) to minimize deviations in system frequency caused due to rapid disturbances in load demand and Renewable Energy Source (RES) penetration. However, large power systems' complexity and the significant frequency deviations observed often limit these controllers. In order to address these issues, a novel Cubature Kalman filter (CKF) and Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) based on combined state estimation and optimal control is proposed. LQR is an optimal controller that curbs the frequency deviations by calculating optimal feedback gain values. The CKF is a novel state estimator algorithm used to estimate the state variables by minimizing the error between actual and estimated states. The proposed control is tested on a small single-area power system and a large-scale power system based in Egypt. The results obtained are compared with the existing Extended Kalman filter (EKF) and LQR-based control, Virtual Synchronous Generator (VSG) based control, and conventional Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control with over and under frequency protection circuit (OUPFC). The efficacy of CKF-LQR is emphasized through the analysis of various simulation cases of the power system. The findings suggested that the proposed controller's performance was robust under frequency measurement noise, low inertia, sudden change in RES, and load switching. The outcome shows that the proposed control is robust and can effectively regulate the system frequency compared to the other controllers. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {A fuzzy adaptive power control strategy was proposed for the issue of insufficient system inertia and frequency response capability caused by the increasing penetration of photovoltaic (PV) power generation in microgrid. Firstly, each adjacent two groups of PV arrays were connected to the microgrid through two parallel Buck-Boost DC / DC converter, and then connected to the microgrid through a DC / AC inverter. One group of PV array operating in the maximum power point tracking mode provides the maximum power reference for the other DC / DC converter operating in the fuzzy adaptive power tracking mode. Secondly, considering the frequency fluctuations caused by load variations and irradiance fluctuations, a fuzzy adaptive controller was designed, which takes the maximum power reference provided by the adjacent PV arrays and the system frequency as input. Then a power reserve factor was generated, and PV output power reference was generated to realize the adaptive regulation of PV power generation. Finally, the PV arrays operating in fuzzy adaptive power tracking mode are with flexible power reserves, which can realize bi-directional regulation of microgrid frequency by adaptively increasing or decreasing the power reservation. This strategy shows the advantages of no requirements of MPP estimator or detailed PV model, and it is easy to implement. The simulation results of an IEEE 13 bus test system demonstrates that the proposed control strategy can effectively suppress the frequency fluctuation of the microgrid. © 2023 Editorial Department of Electric Machines and Control.

	abstract = {A new sliding mode controller (SMC) design is proposed for a single-phase current source rectifier (CSR) integrated into onboard electric vehicle (EV) chargers. The controller's design aims to reduce the impact of varying grid impedance on the CSR's performance by using a disturbance estimator. The proposed method utilizes the Lagrange extrapolation technique for disturbance estimation, which accurately estimates disturbances caused by changes in the grid impedance. The precise state-space equation provided by the disturbance estimator is essential for designing the SMC, which can effectively handle mismatched disturbances. To mitigate the impact of the capacitor inductance filter's resonance frequency, a virtual parallel resistance with the capacitor is used, reducing the resonance amplitude. The proposed controller also controls the power factor to ensure the capacitor voltage and grid current are in phase. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves stability and meets the harmonic content limitations of the IEC61000–3–2 standard. The total harmonic distortion (THD) is also kept below 5% despite changes in the grid impedance, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method in handling varying grid conditions. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This paper presents the design and real-time implementation of a composite controller consisting of a state-feedback control law and high-gain observer for grid-tied inverter with LCL filter. The state-feedback controller is designed in the dq reference frame to stabilize the closed-loop system. High-gain observer serves as a disturbance observer to estimate a fictitious variable, representing the effect of model uncertainties and unknown disturbances, which is then canceled by the state-feedback controller. Thus, asymptotic regulation can be guaranteed under the composite controller even in the presence of parametric uncertainties and unknown inputs. High-gain observer has a rate of convergence that is dependent on its gain which is required to be large enough to ensure fast disturbance estimation, and then nominal performance recovery. However, high observer gain can lead to poor steady-state performances due to the effect of measurement noise. This concern is overcome in this work by using an existing adaptive technique to adjust the observer gain on-line. Moreover, the resulting high-gain observer is further simplified to provide a less-complex estimator and to show its integral action property. The performance of the composite controller was experimentally tested. The obtained results demonstrated the ability of the proposed controller to meet the nominal performance specifications while reducing the effect of measurement noise in steady-state. © 1972-2012 IEEE.},

They establish the frequency-domain equivalent to correlation functions and form powerful representations for assessing nonlinear, non-Gaussian, or non-stationary systems and processes. HOS are subdivided into moment and cumulant spectra. While the latter provide a clear assessment of statistical dependence and favorable mathematical properties, cumulant spectra cannot be estimated directly. Their concept requires the identification and removal of spectra of lower order, analogously to their scalar-valued counterparts. So far, HOS applications have been based on third and fourth order and so has the derivation of cumulant spectra. Computational power, advanced methods, and new estimators put forward the interest in expanding HOS analysis to orders above four. This paper presents the combinatorial framework to define nth-order cumulant spectra in the frequency domain. On this basis, sixth-order spectral estimates are employed to differentiate two processes of same PSD and trispectrum. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper focuses on the event-triggered model-free adaptive predictive load frequency control (LFC) problem for multi-area power systems under false data injection (FDI) attacks. First, the power system model is assumed to be unknown, and the nonlinear power system is converted into an equivalent linear data model using the input and output data of the powerline system. The FDI attacks on the power system is also modeled, and a Bernoulli stochastic process is used to represent whether the data is transmitted successfully or not. Second, the equivalent linear data model to predicts upcoming events, and a new event-triggered model-free adaptive predictive control scheme is designed via the predictions. And a RBF neural network disturbance estimator is designed to estimate and compensate for the effects caused by disturbances, and then power system stability is analyzed. An event-triggered scheme is also developed in the design of the LFC in order to save communication and computational burden. The results show that the designed control algorithm is data-driven independent of the power system structure and does not require the measurement of any system state signals. Finally, the effectiveness and correctness of the scheme is verified by a three-area numerical example and simulation results. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The electrification of vehicles puts forward higher requirements for the power management efficiency of integrated battery management systems as the primary or sole energy supply. In this paper, an efficient adaptive multi-time scale identification strategy is proposed to achieve high-fidelity modeling of complex kinetic processes inside the battery. More specifically, a second-order equivalent circuit model network considering variable characteristic frequency is constructed based on the high-frequency, medium-high-frequency, and low-frequency characteristics of the key kinetic processes. Then, two coupled sub-filters are developed based on forgetting factor recursive least squares and extended Kalman filtering methods and decoupled by the corresponding time-scale information. The coupled iterative calculation of the two sub-filter modules at different time scales is realized by the voltage response of the kinetic diffusion process. In addition, the driver of the low-frequency subalgorithm with the state of charge variation amount as the kernel is designed to realize the adaptive identification of the kinetic diffusion process parameters. Finally, the concept of dynamical parameter entropy is introduced and advocated to verify the physical meaning of the kinetic parameters. The experimental results under three operating conditions show that the mean absolute error and root-mean-square error metrics of the proposed strategy for voltage tracking can be limited to 13 and 16 mV, respectively. Additionally, from the entropy calculation results, the proposed method can reduce the dispersion of parameter identification results by a maximum of 40.72% and 70.05%, respectively, compared with the traditional fixed characteristic frequency algorithms. The proposed method paves the way for the subsequent development of adaptive state estimators and efficient embedded applications. © 2023 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences},

In the proposed framework, the noisy speech spectrum is separated into six distinct and unevenly frequency-spaced subbands as per the psychoacoustic model of the human hearing system, and spectral over-subtraction is applied independently in each subband. The noise in each subband is estimated using an adaptive noise estimator that does not require a speech pause tracker. To compute and update the noise, the noisy speech power is adaptively smoothed using a smoothing factor controlled by a posterior SNR. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated using SNR, segmental SNR (SegSNR), and PESQ scores for a variety of non-stationary and stationary noise environments at varying SNR levels. The experimental results show that the proposed framework outperforms various up-to-date speech enhancement technologies on three extensively used objective metrics assessments and speech spectrograms. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

When the series converter is connected to the primary side, it is possible to use this converter to regulate the load voltage. Nonetheless, if there is no proper care in how the voltage is injected, there is a risk of producing a DC offset on the flux of the main Low-Frequency Transformer (LFT). In that case, the transformer can generate inrush currents. The latter can damage equipment and trigger security systems. This work presents an HDT connected in series to the medium-voltage grid through Coupling Transformers (CTs). The series converter is used to regulate the flux of the main LFT to its rated value and indirectly regulate the load voltage. A flux regulator and a simple flux estimator are presented. Results show that the series converter can successfully regulate the distribution transformer flux, controlling the inrush current and removing the magnetic flux offset from the CTs. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Real-time data-intensive applications in highly mobile environments with high data rates and low latency are one of the key requirements for beyond fifth-generation (5G) communications. Towards this end, a combination of the millimeter wave (mmWave) band with large available spectrum and orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) modulation, which offers robust performance in high mobility scenarios, can be envisioned as a promising solution. However, employing OTFS in the mmWave frequency band is challenging in presence of nonlinear distortions attributed to radio frequency (RF) power amplifier (PA) and complex equalization involved in OTFS receiver in the delay-Doppler domain. The nonlinearity effect of PA is inevitable in mmWave systems due to the high operating frequency and large bandwidth. The nonlinear distortions induce interference and make the target distribution analytically intractable. In this paper, we propose a receiver design for mmWave OTFS systems that aims to address the challenges posed by the nonlinear distortions of the RF PA. The proposed receiver design leverages the use of a large-scale antenna array to decouple the received signal into multiple branches through beamforming. Specifically, we first derive the input-output relation in the delay-Doppler domain with nonlinearity. Then, a combination of maximal-ratio combining (MRC) and iterative particle filter (PF)-based nonlinear detector is proposed to address the issue. We also design a pilot pattern considering the additional interference from the PA impairment. Furthermore, we reformulate the threshold-based channel estimation to incorporate the nonlinearly distorted pilot in its estimation process. Extensive numerical results demonstrate the proposed algorithm's reliability and superiority over existing digital predistorters (DPD) and conventional linear detectors. © 1967-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The proliferation of inverter-based distributed energy resources (DER) makes the interfaced grid face a fast frequency response, and the resulted time-variant frequency features a considerable fluctuation that degrades the frequency stability. This frequency information can be estimated by the phase-locked loops/frequency-locked loops (PLLs/FLLs) embedded in the DER inverters, yet they are difficult to track this frequency and obtain its derivative quickly. This paper aims to tackle this problem. Firstly, a time-variant parameter model is proposed to reflect an accurate relationship between the frequency derivative and the input signal. Since the input signal is defined with ramp frequency, the given model overcomes the inherent time-invariant restriction of the well-known notch filter/model. Then, a nonlinear estimator is derived by the equality-constraint optimization to obtain the model's parameters. The nonlinear estimator avoids the slow convergence speed and biased time-variant parameter tracking induced by the linear estimation framework. The derived linearized model further proves that the proposed estimator can accurately track ramp frequency within 20 ms. Experimental tests under time-variant frequency disturbances verify the proposed estimator's faster and more accurate estimation performance than the commonly-used/recently published PLLs/FLLs. © 1969-2012 IEEE.},

However, the hardware cost and power consumption grow significantly as the number of radio frequency (RF) components increases, which hampers the deployment of practical massive MIMO systems. To address this issue and further facilitate the commercialization of massive MIMO, mixed analog-To-digital converters (ADCs) architecture has been considered, where parts of conventionally assumed full-resolution ADCs are replaced by one-bit ADCs. In this paper, we first propose a deep learning-based (DL) joint pilot design and channel estimation method for mixed-ADCs mmWave massive MIMO. Specifically, we devise a pilot design neural network whose weights directly represent the optimized pilots, and develop a Runge-Kutta model-driven densely connected network as the channel estimator. Instead of randomly assigning the mixed-ADCs, we then design a novel antenna selection network for mixed-ADCs allocation to further improve the channel estimation accuracy. Moreover, we adopt an autoencoder-inspired end-To-end architecture to jointly optimize the pilot design, channel estimation and mixed-ADCs allocation networks. Simulation results show that the proposed DL-based methods have advantages over the traditional channel estimators as well as the state-of-The-Art networks.  © 2002-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Accurate wind power forecasting is vital for (i) wind power management, (ii) penetration increment of the power generated into the power grid, and (iii) making maintenance more efficient. Motivated by the recent application of wavelet transforms and advancements in deep learning methods, a hybrid forecasting method is developed based on the wavelet packet decomposition [WPD], Long Short-Term Memory Network [LSTM], and Convolutional Neural Network [CNN] to improve the accuracy of wind power forecasting. WPD is employed to decompose pre-processed wind power data into sublayers with different frequencies. Sequential Model-Based optimisation (SMBO) with the Tree Parzen Estimator (TPE) is then used to tune the hyper-parameters of LSTM and CNN, efficiently. The optimised LSTM is employed to predict the low-frequency sub-layer that has both long-term and short-term dependencies, and CNN is used to forecast the high-frequency sub-layers with short-term dependencies. To evaluate the prediction performance of the developed method, seven forecasting models, including random forest (RF), feed-forward neural network (FFNN), CNN, LSTM, WPD-FFNN, WPD-CNN, and WPD-LSTM models, are considered as comparison models. Comparing the prediction results of all involved models proves that the developed model improves the prediction accuracy by at least 77.4% compared to methods that do not use WPD. In addition, the proposed combination of optimised CNN and LSTM improves the forecasting accuracy by 26.25% compared to methods that use only one deep learning model to forecast all sub-series. © 2023 The Authors},

Among ACE methods, the reference frequency method (RFM) proposed recently possesses the advantages of being system-independent and not requiring reference phantom. However, the presence of large oscillations in frequency power ratio decay curves leads to unstable ACE results with RFM, originating from noise as well as constructive and destructive interference in the backscattered signals' power spectrum. To address this issue, we propose an improved RFM version where a single-scatterer power spectrum estimator is incorporated to restore interference free single-scatterer power spectrum, thereby reducing oscillations in the frequency power ratio decay curves and greatly improving the accuracy of ACE.  © 2023 IEEE.},

However, positioning in challenging environments demands accurate Doppler estimates to replicate the actual intermediate-frequency (IF) line-of-sight (LOS) GNSS signals. Otherwise, the instantaneous GNSS measurements, like pseudoranges and carrier phases, will be seriously distorted, restricting the upper bound of GNSS positioning. This paper proposes a brand-new super-resolution (SR) GNSS receiver that computes the user's absolute acceleration based on super-long coherent integration (S-LCI), fractional Fourier transform (FRFT), and a baseband maximum likelihood estimator (MLE). A basic nonlinear least square (NLS) navigator taken as an intuitive example shows how the proposed receiver models and generates averaging Doppler rates via the baseband-dependent gradient descent (GD) algorithm. A global positioning system (GPS) software-defined radio (SDR) processing the L5 IF data collected via a mobile cart in the real world validates the proposed technique with the Doppler rate measurement, the user's acceleration navigation solution, and the clock drift rate.  © 2023 IEEE.},

High-frequency inductor currents within dc-dc converters can be estimated instantaneously using voltage measurements taken at its terminals. The voltage measurement at the switching terminal of the inductor is assisted by a comparator, whose output state is related to the corresponding voltage magnitude. This letter presents a novel unified current estimation method in which a single comparator is required to detect the switch node status both in continuous and discontinuous modes of operation. The other measurements required for this method include sensing dc voltage magnitudes, which are essential measurements for a regulated dc-dc converter system; hence the proposed methodology can be easily integrated into existing digital control schemes. The proposed approach has been applied to first-order dc-dc converters and has been validated using a laboratory prototype of a digitally controlled boost converter system using an field programmable gate array (FPGA). © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {As radio frequency (RF) hardware continues to improve, many technologies that were traditionally impractical have suddenly become viable alternatives to legacy systems. Two-way ranging (TWR) is often considered a poor positioning solution for airborne and other vehicular navigation systems due to its low precision, poor angular resolution, and precise timing requirements. With the advent of modern RF hardware and advanced processing techniques, however, modern studies have experimentally demonstrated TWR systems with an unprecedented, sub-centimeter ranging precision with low size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C) consumer-grade hardware. This technique enables a new class of positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) capabilities for urban and commercial aircraft but also instigates new system design challenges such as antenna placement, installation of new electronics, and design of supporting infrastructure. To inform these aircraft design decisions, we derive 2D and 3D Cramér–Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) on position and orientation estimation in a multi-antenna TWR system. We specifically formulate these bounds as a function of the number of antennas, platform geometry, and geometric dilution of precision (GDoP) to inform aircraft design decisions under different mission requirements. We simulate the performance of several classic position and orientation estimators in this context to validate these bounds and to graphically depict the expected performance with respect to these design considerations. To improve the accessibility of these highly theoretical results, we also present a simplified discussion of how these bounds may be applied to common airborne applications and suggest best practices for using them to inform aircraft design decisions. © 2023 by the authors.},

To account for such stochastic uncertainties, many robotic systems leverage probabilistic state estimators such as Kalman filters to obtain a robot's belief, i.e. a probability distribution over possible states. We propose belief control barrier functions (BCBFs) to enable risk-aware control, leveraging all information provided by state estimators. This allows robots to stay in predefined safety regions with desired confidence under these stochastic uncertainties. BCBFs are general and can be applied to a variety of robots that use extended Kalman filters as state estimator. We demonstrate BCBFs on a quadrotor that is exposed to external disturbances and varying sensing conditions. Our results show improved safety compared to traditional state-based approaches while allowing control frequencies of up to 1 kHz.  © 2016 IEEE.},

Both will cause a sharp drop in the phasor monitoring accuracy of phasor measurement units (PMUs) and even lead operational protection devices to malfunction. Thus, a multiple-frequency-Taylor-model (MFTM)-based dynamic synchrophasor estimator considering DDC (MFTDC) is proposed to overcome the adverse effect by modeling dynamic behavior and DDC. Firstly, several sub-phasors extended by the Taylor series are employed to form the dynamic fundamental component and DDC. Secondly, rough phasor estimations are obtained by DFT filters at multiple frequency bins to establish the MFTDC equation set. Then, all Taylor derivatives of MFTDC can be solved by the least square method. Finally, various IEEE standard P-class test and static/dynamic-state DDC test results of computer, PSCAD/EMTDC, and RTDS-generated signals verify that MFTDC is suitable for the protection applications of power systems. It can yield more accurate phasor estimations of PMUs than that of our previous work and shorten the convergence time to 20.3 ms or less, especially under the dynamic-state DDC scenarios. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

Electrolyzers and fuel cells working as hydrogen energy storage can, not only offer electrification of the power sector but also flexible balancing services in the wind turbine generation system. To gain this benefit, this study proposes a probabilistic way to adequately size a hybrid energy storage system composed of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell, an electrolyzer, and a supercapacitor. Using real-world wind data, the proposed method was simulated and compared to others. The simulation results demonstrate that the SC within the hybrid energy storage system can aid in the processing of high-frequency fluctuations, hence extending the hydrogen energy storage lifespan. Furthermore, the supercapacitor assists in addressing peaks in wind power oscillations while avoiding the substantial cost of round-trip losses associated with hydrogen energy storage.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper presents corona discharge current pulse characterization under positive and negative DC voltage excitations. Two electrode systems with three different gap spacings generated corona discharges. Different corona modes in atmospheric air were observed with voltage level changes. Commercial shunt resistors and a high-frequency current transformer (HFCT) captured corona current pulses. The appropriate resistor type and value were determined for the shunt resistor measurement. BNC terminator was proposed as a shunt resistor to detect corona discharge current pulses, and the availability of the shunt resistors and HFCTs for corona pulse detection was discussed. After gathering corona discharge pulse data, features from the pulses were extracted. The best features describing corona discharge types were specified using a recursive feature elimination method based on a decision tree estimator. The corona discharges were discriminated with an accuracy rate of 0.994. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {DC microgrids play a significant role in the effective utilization of distributed power generation. However, there is a problem of real-time disturbance affecting the control effect of bidirectional DC-DC converters, which deteriorates the power quality in DC microgrids. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a variable gain expert self-disturbance rejection stabilizing control strategy. Firstly, a expert system is designed based on the state observer theory and organically combined with the extended state observer. A dynamic adjustment factor is introduced to achieve online optimization of the observer gain. Secondly, expert rules and variable gain self-disturbance control strategy are developed based on the observation absolute error and control strength demand during the disturbance rejection process. The range of dynamic adjustment factor values is provided. The theoretical analysis is conducted in terms of observation tracking performance, disturbance rejection frequency domain characteristics, noise suppression, and the impact of time variant gain on the system's disturbance resistance. The results show that the proposed control strategy can effectively improve the system performance. Finally, simulation and experimental verifications are carried out, and the results demonstrate that the variable gain expert self-disturbance rejection control outperforms the traditional dual-loop PI and LADRC control under various operating conditions. © 2023 SPIE.},

In this letter, we propose an efficient CFO estimation method for OFDM systems with in- and quadrature-phase (IQ) imbalance, which combines the emerging multitask learning (MTL) with the channel residual energy (CRE) to reduce the average inferring time greatly. The MTL estimator can extract the correlated features between the CFO and the IQ imbalance so as to mitigate the intractable coupling effect. On the other hand, the CRE technique can guide the neural network and loss function design to improve the estimation accuracy and the training efficiency. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposal achieves high estimation accuracy while the inferring time is significantly reduced compared with other methods.  © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The distributed control of a microgrid is fully dependent on advanced information and communication technologies that are sensitive to cyber-physical systems. Cyberattacks, such as denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, can cause unstable operation of low-inertia microgrids. This paper proposes enhanced microgrid virtual inertia control under DoS attacks using an improved resilient model predictive control (IRMPC)-based virtual energy storage system (VESS). IRMPC comprises an attack detector, an autoregressive (AR)-based signal estimator, and an MPC-based VESS controller. An attack detector was used to detect the DoS attacks. An AR-based signal estimator is then used to estimate the feedback data that are subjected to DoS attacks. The firefly algorithm was used to optimize the AR parameters. The effectiveness of the proposed IRMPC was compared with that of conventional model predictive control, conventional model predictive control-based VESS, and resilient model predictive control-based VESS. The simulation results revealed that under a DoS attack, the proposed IRMPC can successfully improve the microgrid virtual inertia emulation. Additionally, the proposed IRMPC has a performance effect over the compared techniques in terms of the reduction in RoCoF deviation and frequency deviation during normal situations, DoS attacks, and disconnection of wind turbine generation. The simulation results also confirmed that IRMPC is robust to microgrid parameter variations when compared to the other methods.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) is a highly promising technology that enables the ubiquitous deployment of low-cost, low-power devices to support the next generation of Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. This paper addresses channel estimation for full-duplex multi-antenna AmBC systems. This is highly challenging due to the large number of channel parameters resulting from the use of multiple antennas, the presence of self-interference, and the dependence of the backscattering channel on the state of the backscattering device. Considering both pilot-based and semi-blind estimation strategies, we propose three solutions for this problem. The first is the pilot-based maximum-likelihood (ML) estimator. The second is a semi-blind estimator based on the expectation maximization (EM) framework, which provides higher accuracy than the ML, at the cost of higher computational complexity. The third is a semi-blind estimator based on the decision-directed (DD) strategy, which provides a tradeoff between the ML and the EM. Additionally, we derive the exact Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for pilot-based estimation and the modified CRB for semi-blind estimation. Simulations show that the ML and the EM perform very close to their respective CRBs, and that the semi-blind estimators offer significantly higher estimation accuracy, as well as superior symbol-error-rate performance, compared to the ML estimator.  © 1972-2012 IEEE.},

Compared with traditional antennas, the HPO antennas have a simpler structure, lower power consumption and cost, which can alleviate the pain points in current fifth generation (5G) communication. However, the existing channel estimators cannot be applied into the HPO-SISO systems directly because the loss of phase information. The DCD-KMGS algorithm solves the problem by reconstructing the channel based on the phase measurements under the Bayesian framework. The core of DCD-KMGS algorithm is Gibbs sampling (GS) algorithm which can iteratively reconstruct the channel based on the real channel prior distribution and phase measurements. To obtain the channel prior distribution, the K-means clustering is applied to transform the real channel samples into the discrete prior distribution of the real channel, which can simplify the calculation of the channel prior distribution and the initialization of GS iteration. Then the damp, dropout and cluster deletion (CD) mechanisms are applied to increase the robust and lower the computational complexity. In the end, simulation experiments verify that DCD-KMGS algorithm correctly reconstructs channel in the HPO-SISO system and iterative gains.  © 2023 IEEE.},

It combines three algorithms with favorable asymptotic statistical properties: a periodogram-based iterative frequency estimator, a Discrete-Time Fourier Transform (DTFT)-based method of estimating amplitude and phase, and a changepoint detection (CPD) method for estimating the FO start and stop samples. Each of these have been shown in the literature to be approximate maximum likelihood estimators (MLE), meaning that for large enough sample size or signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), they can be unbiased and reach the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound in variance. The proposed method is shown through Monte Carlo simulations of a low-order model of the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) power system to achieve statistical efficiency for low SNR values. The proposed method is validated with data measured from the January 11, 2019 US Eastern Interconnection (EI) FO event. It is shown to accurately extract the FO parameters and remove electromechanical mode meter bias, even with a time-varying FO amplitude © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The upcoming sixth generation (6G) of wireless communication systems is expected to enable a wide range of new applications in vehicular communication. However, the use of multicarrier-based modulation in vehicular communication introduces challenges due to the Doppler effects, which can induce nonlinear distortions at high-power amplifiers (HPAs) and significantly degrade channel estimation. In this paper, we investigate the performance of long short-term memory (LSTM)-based channel estimation considering the nonlinear HPA memory effects. Our results reveal the impact of these nonlinearities on the detection of transmitted signals, highlighting the importance of considering these often neglected effects when developing vehicular communication solutions for practical scenarios. We further present a low-complexity method for compensating for part of the NLD memory effects on the transmitter side, while handling the remaining distortions along with channel estimation. In addition, we emphasize the ability of certain estimators to handle these distortions at the receiver and present their advantages for tracking the vehicular channel.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {To sustain the reliability of the connected grid system's performance, it's crucial to spot any low frequency oscillations that are poorly damped. But in actual, due to the increase in the installment of Phasor measurement units (PMUs), the data collected at Phasor data concentrators (PDCs) may contain non - linear data with missing values and outliers, which results in a decay in the performance of the estimator and affects system stability. This can happen due to heavy communication network congestion, malicious attacks, malfunctioning PMUs or PDCs, among other factors. In this situation, this paper discusses the use of Self organizing maps (SOM) technique in the beginning to give a substantial data set to handle such a problem. The second phase involves identifying the oscillatory modes using the improved total least square estimation ofjsignal parameters through rotational invariance technique (TLS-ESPRIT) algorithm. For generated test signals with missing data and outliers at various noise levels, the suggested method has been compared against Bayesian low-rank matrix/Hankel tensor factorization (BLMF/BLTF) with k-Medoids clustering and ML-based ERA (ML-ERA). The effectiveness of the suggested algorithm is further illustrated on two area data and real probing data collected from Western Electricity Co-ordinating Council (WECC).  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Harmonic monitoring is important in complying with power quality standards and mitigating waveform distortion. A well-developed harmonic monitoring system can provide full observability with limited number of meters. Limiting the number of harmonic meters is equivalent to reducing the harmonic monitoring cost. In this paper, harmonic voltage estimation is addressed by using a limited number of meters which forms an underdetermined system of equations. By employing Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Genetic Algorithm (GA), a monitoring system is proposed which outperforms other techniques in terms of accuracy. Two types of ANNs including Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN) are respectively used to locate harmonic sources and develop pseudo monitoring stations which accordingly will estimate harmonic voltages. GA is employed to guarantee the accuracy of pseudo-estimators. Low frequency harmonics of 3rd, 5th and 7th order have been studied. The proposed method has been simulated for the IEEE-14 bus test systems. The comparison of the proposed methods with state-of-the-art techniques shows the same or improved effectiveness and accuracy, even with a reduced number of measurements.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The ultra-supercritical boiler-turbine unit is required to accommodate large-range load following to maintain the stability of grid frequency. However, the input delay in the coal pulverizing process poses a challenge to the coordinated control of the boiler-turbine unit, which is always neglected in existing works but dramatically affects the stability of steam pressure and temperature. In this paper, to handle the delay caused by coal pulverizing, a predictor-based delay compensation structure is developed for producing a delay-free control framework for the throttle steam pressure. Moreover, to overcome intrinsic nonlinearities in the dynamics of the boiler-turbine unit, the unknown system dynamics estimator is employed in the controllers' design for the steam enthalpy in the separator and active power of the turbine. Thus, precise and fast regulation for the active power output can be achieved under wide load following task. The salient merit of the proposed control is that the overshot of the throttle steam pressure and the specific enthalpy in the separator can be significantly alleviated, which is necessary for turbine blade. A Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional is introduced to deal with the time delay in the stability proof. Finally, the proposed coordinated control is validated in three typical working scenarios. © 2022 Chinese Automatic Control Society and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Grid frequency regulation is essential for a reliable power grid. Whilst in distributed energy sources, (DERs) power fluctuations arise from the imbalance of frequency. There are multiple conventional and recent advanced frequency regulation techniques to dissolve this issue. The existing techniques using conventional controllers in microgrid control are well suited for voltage regulation, but the frequency cannot be adequately controlled using conventional and linear controllers. Most of the advanced control methods use algorithms to manage the grid frequency stability. This review comprehensively discusses the advanced control techniques for frequency regulation in micro-grids namely model predictive control, adaptive control, sliding mode control, h-infinity control, back-stepping control, (Disturbance estimation technique) kalman state estimator-based strategies, and intelligent control methods. Each control method is briefly explained along with recent advancements and corresponding governing equations. At glace, these control techniques are comparatively studied by elaborating future requirements. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Since Bluetooth version 5.1, Angle of Arrival (AoA) and Angle of Departure (AoD) techniques have been integrated to improve the accuracy of localization. The utilization of radio frequency switches between Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) transceivers and antennas can save the cost and power consumption of BLE direction finding systems. As a result, the direction of an input signal can be determined by the measured phase difference between signals sampled from different slots. Nevertheless, due to the limitation of only one active antenna at a given time, the precision of the estimated phase difference is considerably influenced by the frequency offset of incident signals. To address this issue, our study introduces a novel method for estimating phase differences by employing the Best Linear Unbiased Estimator (BLUE). The proposed method allows for direct phase difference calculation without the requirement to estimate the frequency of the incident signals in the reference period. Consequently, our method not only eliminates phase errors caused by carrier frequency offset (CFO) but also reduces phase errors caused by carrier frequency drift (CFD). Numerical analysis demonstrates that when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) exceeds 7 dB, the mean square error (MSE) of our proposed method closely approximates the Cramér-Ran Lower Bound (CRLB), while maintaining a computational complexity of O(N). © 2023 IEEE.},

This paper uses the idea to estimate the integer part of frequency component using FFT and then fractional part is calculated using Hybrid A&M (Aboutanios and Mulgrew) q-shift estimator (HAQSE) algorithm. A periodicity filter is used to detect whether interharmonics are present in the signal or not. To show the effectiveness of the proposed method a comparison has also been made in terms of estimation time required by the algorithm with respect to parametric method. The method is tested using synthetic signals. Relative rms reconstruction error is also calculated which shows that the estimation performed is accurate.

	abstract = {In this study, we propose a novel machine learning based algorithm to improve the performance of beyond 5 generation (B5G) wireless communication system that is assisted by Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) and Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) techniques. The non-linear soft margin support vector machine (SVM) problem is used to provide an automatic modulation classifier (AMC) and a signal power to noise and interference ratio (SINR) estimator. The estimation results of AMC and SINR are used to reassign the modulation type, codding rate, and transmit power throughout the frames of eNode B connections. The AMC success rate versus SINR, total power consuming, and sum capacity are evaluated for OFDM-NOMA assisted 5G system. In comparison to recently published methods, our results show that the success rate improves. The suggested method directly senses the physical channel because it computes the SINR and codding rate of received signal just after the signal is detected by successive interference cancellation (SIC). Hence, because of this direct sense, this algorithm can really decrease occupied symbols (overhead signaling) for channel quality information (CQI) in network communication signaling. The results also prove that the proposed algorithm reduces the total power consumption and increases the sum capacity during the eNode B connections. Simulation results compared to other algorithms show more successful AMC, efficient SINR estimator, easier practical implantation, less overhead signaling, less power consumption, and more capacity achievement. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {This letter proposes two carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimators by utilizing the likelihood ratio test (LRT) for coherent optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (CO-OFDM) systems. The zero-information in real and imaginary parts of the effective data subcarriers can be detected by LRT for flexible modulation formats. An LRT-based blind estimator (LRT-BE) algorithm is then proposed by using power fluctuations of the zero-information. An LRT-based simplified fine estimator (LRT-SFE) is subsequently developed to reduce complexity by approximating the cost function as a cosine function. The closed-form expression of CFO estimate is derived by using three arbitrary test values, which is computationally efficient. The blind zero-information detection procedure transfers the LRT-based methods to a sort of semi-blind estimator which improves the estimation accuracy, and the optimal threshold derived by LRT makes the proposed methods be robust to M -QAM modulations. Simulation results verify the accuracy, flexibility and efficiency of the proposed algorithms. At the MSE of 10-4, the SNR gain of LRT-SFE is upto 6.5 dB compared to other blind estimators.  © 1997-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Conventional sensorless control of permanent magnet synchronous motors in the full speed domain achieves rotor position estimation by combining the two position estimation methods. However, in wide frequency domain speed regulation, the two position estimation methods switch frequently, which can easily cause oscillations in the estimated position and speed. Moreover, the two position estimation methods require separate design and tuning, increasing the difficulty of system tuning and algorithm complexity. For this reason, this paper proposes a unified full-speed sensorless control method of interior permanent magnet synchronous motor based on resonance extended state observer. First, the fundamental frequency back electromotive force and high-frequency back electromotive force are estimated by the resonant extended state observer. This observer adds a high-frequency disturbance estimation loop based on the traditional extended state observer. Accordingly, the high-frequency back electromotive force in the low-speed zone generated by injecting high-frequency voltage is estimated, and the fundamental frequency back electromotive force is estimated by the original disturbance estimation loop of the extended state observer. The original disturbance estimation loop of the extended state observer has the characteristics of a notch filter at the frequency of injected high-frequency voltage. In addition, it can suppress the high-frequency measurement noise, which can accurately estimate the fundamental frequency back electromotive force. The high-frequency disturbance estimation loop of the resonant extended state observer has band-pass filter characteristics with no amplitude attenuation and phase lag at the frequency of the injected high-frequency voltage, allowing it to accurately estimate the high-frequency back electromotive force. Then, a unified model in the full-speed domain is established, and the rotor position and speed estimation are realized through the unified model. At zero speed and low speed, the signal-to-noise ratio of the fundamental frequency back electromotive force is low, so it cannot accurately estimate the fundamental frequency back electromotive force. By injecting high-frequency voltage into the d-axis, the signal-to-noise ratio of the high-frequency back electromotive force is increased. However, the high-frequency back electromotive force is modulated by the injected high-frequency signal, which cannot be directly used to estimate the rotor position. A unified full-speed domain model is constructed to achieve a high signal-to-noise ratio of rotor position information in the full-speed domain. The amplitude of the unified full-speed domain model is the sum of the square of the fundamental frequency back electromotive force amplitude and the square of the high-frequency back electromotive force amplitude. The output of the unified full-speed domain model is used as the input of the phase-locked loop, and the output of the phase-locked loop is the estimated rotor position and speed. Finally, the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed method are verified on the 2.0 kW interior permanent magnet synchronous motor experimental platform. Compared with the traditional sensorless control method, the proposed method has the following advantages: (1) The full-speed domain uses the same estimator without a transition zone, simplifying the control algorithm, reducing tuning difficulty, and avoiding speed and position oscillations caused by frequent switching of the two observers. (2) Estimation errors caused by filters and delays in traditional high-frequency injection methods are eliminated. © 2023 Chinese Machine Press. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The covariance structure for vibrations of the noising mechanism for a port crane and a wind turbine with gear tooth breakage are studied on the basis of their models in the form of periodically non-stationary random processes (PNRPs). The investigation is performed by the authors using PNRP statistical analysis methods. The estimations of the basic frequencies of the vibration’s deterministic components and the time changes of the power for the stochastic part (the PNRP variance) are the key issues of this analysis. In the present paper, the basic frequency estimators are obtained using the least squares technique which are characterized by the maximum of the signal-to-noise ratio as compared with techniques known in the literature. Using the basic frequency, values for the Fourier coefficients for the mean and covariance functions are calculated and the dependencies of the forenamed moment functions on time and lag are ascertained. The amplitude spectra of the deterministic oscillations and the time changes of the power of the stochastic part are presented. These spectra are considered as the symptomatic features of the mechanism’s state of health. It is revealed that the high-frequency modulation of PNRP carrier harmonics is narrow-band for both distributed and localized faults. Using bandpass filtering and Hilbert transform, the quadratures for each high-frequency component are separated and analyzed. It is shown that the auto- and cross-covariance structure of the high-frequency component quadratures characterizes the specific features of the different types of faults. Using the cross-covariance map for high-frequency components, the peculiarities of the bandpass filtering of vibrations for a damaged wind turbine’s gearbox as a PNRP’s is considered. It is shown that the filtering bandwidth cannot be narrower than 14 times the basic frequency. This bandwidth essentially exceeds that recommended in the literature (two to three times the basic frequency). © 2023 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Monitoring the voltage frequency is of great significance in power systems. In this paper we propose two novel frequency estimators, namely the unbalanced HAM-WLS (UHW) estimator and the weighted least squares fusion (WLSF) estimator, to identify the voltage frequency in unbalanced three-phase power systems. The UHW method modifies both the coarse search and the weighted least squares (WLS) post-processing step of our previous HAM-WLS algorithm, and thus removes the spectrum leakage caused by the fluctuant maxima of the signal periodogram in phase unbalanced grids. Meanwhile, a new alternative is used in the WLSF estimator to aggregate the signal information in three difference phases. Compared with the Clarke's transformation that merely maximizes signal to noise ratios (SNRs), the proposed WLSF assigns different weights to the single-phase estimates according to their estimation variances, leading to improved accuracy and higher reliability. Both proposed estimation algorithms employ the Fourier coefficient interpolation and the iterative leakage subtraction in the frequency domain to lower the computation complexity as well as the WLS technique as a post-processing step to enhance the estimation precision. Therefore, both estimators realize accurate estimates with low computational cost. The complexity calculation, simulations and experiments for various scenarios all support the analysis. The results also show that the WLSF estimator exhibits more precise and stable performance than the UHW estimator at the cost of requiring relatively higher computational effort. © 1986-2012 IEEE.},

Muscle forces are expected to provide even more comprehensive information than EMG to control these assistive rehabilitation devices. Measuring in vivo muscle force is challenging, leading to the development of numerical methods to estimate them. Due to their high computational cost, forward dynamics-based optimization algorithms were not viable for real-time estimation until recently. To achieve muscle forces estimation in real time, a moving horizon estimator (MHE) algorithm was used to track experimental biosignals. Two participants were equipped with EMG sensors and skin markers that were streamed in real time and used as targets for the MHE. The upper-limb musculoskeletal (MSK) model was composed of 10 degrees-of-freedom actuated by 31 muscles. The MHE relies on a series of overlapping trajectory optimization subproblems of which the following parameters have been adjusted: the fixed duration and the frame to export. We based this adjustment on the estimation delay, the muscle saturation, the joint kinematic mean power frequency, and errors to experimental data. Our algorithm provided consistent estimates of muscle forces and kinematics with visual feedback at 30 Hz with a 110 ms delay. This method is promising to guide rehabilitation and enrich assistive device control laws with personalized force estimations. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellite communications are the research topics of 6G communication. High-order QAM/APSK communication transceiver design is the core research technology. Moreover, it pays more attention to overcoming the high-speed Doppler frequency offset problem of LEO. The blind frequency offset estimation technique is a popular solution. To achieve the blind estimator, the pre-processor of the high-order power operation is proposed to remove the coexisting high-order QAM/APSK signals. Therefore, the pre-processed received signal reserves the pure frequency offset signals, which can be used for a phase-locked loop (PLL) to estimate the frequency offset. In this paper, we will propose the overall frequency/time/channel synchronization and demodulation schemes for the high-order QAM/APSK system. Besides, the pre-processing operation of high-order power, i.e., the 16th-order power operation used for 32QAM, is the key technology of hardware realization. The hybrid coordinate rotation digital computer (CORDIC) techniques are proposed to jointly complete the high-order power operations. Finally, the software-defined radio (SDR) platform confirms that the proposed transceiver with the hardware realization exhibits the excellent performance. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Setting blocking on the electricity transmission network distance protection is an important control measure to prevent it from malfunctioning in the out-of-step oscillation (OOSO) process. However, this operation makes it lose the ability to cut off faults. Once fault occurs, the consequences are serious, which might bring huge energy loss. How to effectively identify faults and quickly restore its protection capability is an important engineering task, but it's also filled with challenges. For the symmetrical faults occurring at δ≈180∘, the traditional technologies are susceptible to failure because the system seems to be oscillating continuously. For asymmetric faults, the sequence component method can be adopted, but limited by the sequence component extraction speed. Aiming at the above existing problems, this paper launches the targeted study and gives the corresponding solutions. To the former, it innovatively analyzes the variation law about the frequency difference of bus voltage (BV) and system current (SC) before and after fault occurs in the OOSO process, and gives its change range through strict mathematical derivation. Based on this, it proposes a novel one terminal setting-free distance protection unlocking scheme for symmetrical fault. Experiments show that the new variables defined in the criterion change abruptly and last for 3 sampling points after a fault. The new method can effectively identify faults occurring at δ≈180∘. This is an important advantage over the traditional methods. To the latter, it constructs a phasor imaginary part estimator, and proposes a sequence component transient calculation method. It greatly improves the asymmetric fault identification speed of the related method. © 2023 The Author(s)},

However, the topology and operating environment of the microgrid cluster are more complex, in order to realize the problem of multi-region cooperative control of microgrid cluster, this paper proposes a novel control algorithm, i.e., the improved lookahead algorithm. Compared with the traditional reinforcement learning, the maximum expectation estimation represented by Q-learning overuses the greedy strategy, which in turn results in the overestimation of the action value; while the dual estimation method represented by DQ-learning uses too conservative a strategy and always abandons the greedy strategy in strategy selection, resulting in the underestimation of the action value in the process of strategy exploration. The interleaved Q-learning (IQ) algorithm uses the coupled estimation method to avoid the overestimation problem arising from the maximum estimator (ME) and the underestimation problem arising from the double estimator (DE). In this paper, based on Q-learning, interleaved Q-learning (IQ) is integrated into the lookaheadQ algorithm to design an improved lookahead algorithm, and at the same time, the qualification traces are integrated into the improved lookahead algorithm for algorithmic backtracking to obtain the maximum return in the past and the future.  © 2023 IEEE.},

By utilizing phasor measurement units (PMUs), a combined robust centralized dynamic algebraic approach is proposed in this paper for estimating algebraic states (voltage phasors) as well as dynamic states (associated with synchronous generators and wind turbines). Assuming that a load is placed on each bus, an innovative PMU placement method is also presented to provide measurements for all dynamic and algebraic state variables. As a robust link between algebraic state estimation and dynamic state estimation, the output results of the least absolute value (LAV) estimator, which is robust against bad data, are fed to dynamic state estimators as pseudo measurements. Next, to address the nonlinearity of synchronous generator and wind turbine models, an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) is applied to estimate dynamic states precisely. The numerical tests on a microgrid test system show that the suggested approach is suitable for both algebraic and dynamic state estimation. Synchronous generators and wind turbines are modeled using nonlinear models of the 9th and third orders, respectively, and static loads are modeled as voltage-frequency dependent ones. © 2023 The Authors.

When compared to the conventional phase-locked loop (PLL), the provided controller can significantly reduce phase distortions and low-order harmonics from the load voltage while attaining quicker dynamic response. Furthermore, the fundamental attribute of the load voltage allows the integrated DC-AC converter to operate at a consistent frequency eliminating frequency oscillations. The SRPE is utilized primarily in the DQ control theory as the reference voltage generator which can compensate for the grid voltage. SRPE has good band-pass filtering properties and a mathematically simple structure that can thoroughly attenuate voltage imbalance and has quick dynamic response. The SRPE has been made to be frequency-adaptive using a damping factor and robust grid frequency estimation. The SRPE can maintain the fundamental frequency at 50 Hz and keep the total harmonic distortions (THD) within the 5% limit even during grid disruptions. The DC-AC converter and SRPE-DQ’s stability are thoroughly examined. The experiment is carried out to show the efficacy of the suggested complete control system. There are also comparative simulation studies to show the benefits of the suggested technique. The results reveal that the suggested approach can immediately identify and correct for any grid voltage imbalance while also assisting in maintaining the constant voltage at the load side despite voltage sag/swell and distortions. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Millimeter wave (mmWave) with two way relaying (TWR) is an emerging paradigm towards cellular fifth/sixth generation (5G/6G) technology that can support various data hungry applications with improve coverage, network throughput, and reliability. The foreseen potential of mmWave TWR system can be further alleviated by using large-scale multiple input multiple output (MIMO) architecture. However, high power consumption, hardware complexity and cost of fully digital large-scale MIMO architecture restricts its application. As a countermeasure, hybrid precoding structures with reduced RF chains are utilized. Therefore, the amalgamation of TWR MIMO mmWave system with hybrid precoding structure demands an accurate channel state information (CSI) to avail the maximum gain of two way MIMO communications. Furthermore, the inherent self-interference in TWR systems in collusion with sparse mmWave channels imposes severe challenges in acquiring accurate CSI. The challenge is further aggravated in case of frequency-selective mmWave channel. To solve this problem, we propose a novel iterative variational Bayesian inference (IVBI)-based channel estimation (CE) scheme in the time domain for TWR system with reduced RF chain. In the proposed method, we follow the alternative minimization method involving variational Bayesian inference (VBI) to estimate all the channels of mmWave TWR system. The performance of the proposed algorithm are evaluated over both flat fading and frequency-selective channel. Extensive simulation results for symmetric and non-symmetric MIMO structure validate the proposed algorithm. The Bayesian Cramer-Rao bound (BCRB) of the proposed estimator is also derived. This novel scheme converges fast and achieves significant improvement in terms of normalized mean square error (NMSE) and bit error rate (BER) as compared to state-of-art.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.},

However, complicated dynamic frequency interaction, active power oscillation, and inappropriate transient active power-sharing will occur when VSGs are widely applied. Center of Inertia (COI) is introduced for solving these problems. But the calculation of COI frequency relies on global communication and a centralized controller, which results in high communication costs and complexity, and reduces the system reliability. This paper proposes a distributed control method via COI frequency for multi-VSG grids. The COI frequency estimator is designed based on dynamic consensus control. Communication between adjacent neighbors is required, which improves reliability and reduces communication costs. The stability of the proposed control method is proved and the feasible range of the control parameter is presented in this paper.

	abstract = {Millimeter wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input multiple-output (massive MIMO) is one of the most promising technologies for the fifth generation and beyond wireless communication system. However, a large number of antennas incur high power consumption and hardware costs, and high-frequency communications place a heavy burden on the analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) at the base station (BS). Furthermore, it is too costly to equipping each antenna with a high-precision ADC in a large antenna array system. It is promising to adopt low-resolution ADCs to address this problem. In this letter, we investigate the cascaded channel estimation for a mmWave massive MIMO system aided by a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) with the BS equipped with few-bit ADCs. Due to the low-rank property of the cascaded channel, the estimation of the cascaded channel can be formulated as a low-rank matrix completion problem. We introduce the Bayesian optimal inference framework to tackle with the information loss caused by quantization. To implement the estimator and achieve the matrix completion, we use efficient bilinear generalized approximate message passing (BiG-AMP) algorithm. Extensive simulation results verify that our proposed method can accurately estimate the cascaded channel for the RIS-aided mmWave massive MIMO system with low-resolution ADCs.  © 1997-2012 IEEE.},

To meet the ever-increasing demands on better wireless communications for IIoT, we propose an orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) waveform-based joint communication and radio sensing (JCAS) scheme - an energy-efficient solution for not only reliable communications but also high-accuracy sensing. OTFS has been demonstrated to have higher reliability and energy efficiency than the currently popular IIoT communication waveforms. JCAS has also been highly recommended for IIoT, since it saves cost, power, and spectrum compared to having two separate radio frequency systems. Performing JCAS based on OTFS, however, can be hindered by a lack of effective OTFS sensing. This article is dedicated to filling this technology gap. We first design a series of echo preprocessing methods that successfully remove the impact of communication data symbols in the time-frequency domain, where major challenges, such as intercarrier and intersymbol interference and noise amplification, are addressed. Then, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for sensing and optimize a key parameter of the proposed method to maximize the SINR. The extensive simulations show that the proposed sensing method approaches the maximum-likelihood estimator with respect to the estimation accuracy of target parameters and manifests applicability to wide ranges of key system parameters. Notably, the complexity of the proposed method is only dominated by a 2-D Fourier transform.  © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Frequency estimation plays a crucial role in monitoring and protecting smart grids. The excellence of discrete Fourier transform (DFT)-based frequency estimators has been well known due to their efficiency and robustness. However, multi-component interference has become one of the biggest challenges of DFT-based estimators. To this end, we propose a novel DFT-based method for estimating multifrequency real-valued sinusoidal signals, which consist of P unknown components. The proposed method first constructs a nonlinear equation to describe the relationship between the parameters of all components and their frequency spectrum. The nonlinear equation is then transformed into a linear equation with 3P unknowns for estimating the frequency. The proposed method takes the sidelobe interference and spectrum leakage of all components into consideration. As a result, the impacts of multi-component interference can be completely avoided. Experiments and simulations demonstrate that the proposed method not only meets the limitations of Standard IEC/IEEE 60255-118-1 but is also highly competitive with existing frequency estimators.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Objectives: For underwater acoustic (UWA) communication, the time-domain distortion of received baseband signal caused by residual Doppler frequency shift decreases the performance of channel equalizer especially in communication systems of long-frame data format. Digital phase-locked loop (DPLL) can compensate the phase difference between local carrier frequency and the received signal. However, the only DPLL cannot eliminate the time-domain extension of baseband signal, which will increase the timing error of detection symbols and lead to the re-divergence of equalizer after convergence. The real-time processing of UWA communication is limited to the computation complexity of receiver algorithm, a reasonable signal processing routine should be organized. Methods: We propose a Farrow interpolation based fractionally-spaced decision feedback equalizer (FFSDFE) to accomplish baseband signal recovery. A Farrow structure based interpolator is introduced into the operation loop and compensate the Doppler effect combined with DPLL. The Doppler factor is firstly estimated by fix frequency interval search, i. e. coarse Doppler factor, using fast Fourier transform method. Instant carrier phase error is calculated by equivalent phase discriminator with equalizer output error. The modified loop filter, with an additional integrate-dump step, smooths the phase error and gets the fine Doppler factor. The summary of Doppler factor estimators is utilized for signal interpolation, the time-domain extension or compression of baseband is mitigated in the same time. The fast recursive least squares (FRLS) algorithm, modified from stable fast trans-versal filter algorithm, is exploited for adaptive adaptation of fractionally-spaced decision feedback equalizer. The FRLS algorithm for FFSDFE reduces the computation complexity of recursive least squares from square relation to linear relation of equalizer length. Results: The results of simulations and lake trial show that: (1) The proposed scheme can endure the situation of fix Doppler factor, with 1 Hz residual Doppler frequency shift in the worst case after coarse search, and dynamic Doppler factor during one data frame in simulations. In addition, the bit error rate (BER) is reduced from 0.002 7 to 0 in fixed Doppler factor, and from 0.481 2 to 0.001 1 in dynamic Doppler factor. (2) The time cost of the Doppler processing procedure and three kinds of real-time equalization algorithms are measured in low-power consumption platform used in field environment. Different parameter configurations are made for different channel environment. (3) The performance of real-time UWA communication using the proposed scheme is tested by maximum 1 000 m lake trial in summer, and the BER of received signal attains to 7.95×10-5 at 500 m and 3.03×10-4 at 1 000 m which satisfy the engineering requirements. Conclusions: The proposed scheme is an engineering realization of real-time UWA communication system implementation, the BER performance is improved by combined structure of Farrow interpolator, modified DPLL and FSDFE. Hence, in the future work, we will concentrate on large-scale Doppler effect within frames and search for methods of further computation complexity reduction in order to tackle harsher UWA channel. © 2023 Wuhan University.

Prony’s method can be used as an estimator by which electrical power system parameters are approximated. The Prony algorithm is challenging under noise conditions due to its frequency-adaptive parameter estimations. Joining several channels of PMUs was suggested recently in the literature as a way to counter this. However, implementing this comes at the expense of a considerable increase in the computational burden and thereby its applicability is restricted in real-time applications. A recursive multi-channel Prony technique is presented in this paper where several channels are used to estimate the phasor of one variable (voltage/current) accurately and efficiently. The proposed method speeds up the phasor estimation process by utilising the previous estimates. Various requirements presented in IEEE standard C37.118.1 are employed to assess the performance of the proposed method in different conditions. Finally, the proposed method is examined by two real-world data-sets: Measured current from a Mexican power system, processed offline in MATLAB, and measured voltage from National Instrument devices, processed online in LABVIEW. The proposed method performs efficiently for both the synthesised and real data. © 2023 IEEE.},

Considering accurate harmonic phasor information is necessary to deal with harmonic related issues, this paper focuses on realizing accurate dynamic harmonic phasor estimation when the signal is contaminated by certain interharmonic tones, i.e. the out-of-band interference (OBI). Specifically, this work introduces the singular value decomposition into the Taylor-Fourier transform algorithm, deriving a general decomposition form for harmonic phasor filters, and yielding a set of adjustable parameters. Then these parameters are configured to minimize the negative influence of OBI on the dynamic harmonic phasor filters. Based on the recommended parameter values, the optimized harmonic estimator is obtained, and then tested under signals distorted by OBI, harmonic, noise, and in worse cases, frequency deviation, and some dynamic conditions. Test results show the proposal achieves good harmonic phasor estimation even under multiple interferences and dynamic scenarios, and has a much weaker dependence on OBI tones compared to conventional approaches.  © 1986-2012 IEEE.},

Conventionally, a current sensor or zero-current detector is required to realize CRM operation. The system performances highly rely on the behaviors of peripheral circuits. Additional power loss and delay are also introduced. Moreover, the inductor current contains obvious differential mode noise, which brings interferences to the sensing signals. To address this issue, a novel CRM realization method is proposed. It utilizes an inductor current estimator model to estimate the averaged current and to predict the current zero crossings. The noisy sensing signal is replaced by estimated values. Therefore, the zero-current detection circuit is removed, which simplifies the peripheral circuit design. Valley switching and zero-voltage switching can also be achieved. Operation principles, digital implementation, and error suppression of the proposed control are analyzed. The proposed concepts are validated on a 550-W, 150kHz-1.6MHz, GaN-based prototype. Experimental results record 98.96% peak efficiency with a 0.9972 power factor.  © 1986-2012 IEEE.},

In literature, RIS beamformer is designed using channel state information (CSI) or by scanning through gNodeB and user codebooks over different training RIS weight matrices. Both of these methods incur significant training overhead. Also, the traditional subspace-based AoA estimators require several power-intensive radio frequency (RF) chains, which is not practically affordable to users. As a low-power and low-complexity alternative, we propose to design RIS beamforming weights based on angle-of-arrival (AoA) from gNodeB-to-RIS and from RIS-to-user with a single RF chain coupled to an antenna array. The proposed estimator is a combination of maximum likelihood and maximum correlation estimator and uses a single RIS training matrix. The simulation results show that, though a slightly larger number of antenna elements is required for the same spectral efficiency, the proposed approach offers a significantly energy- and computationally-efficient beamforming alternative compared to the existing subspace-based AoA estimator and CSI based techniques.  © 1997-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In this paper, an enhancement to the well known Phasor Power Oscillation Damper is proposed, aiming to improve its performance. Fundamental to the functioning of this controller is the estimation of a phasor representing oscillations at a particular frequency in a measured signal. The phasor is transformed to time domain and applied as a setpoint signal to a controllable device. The contribution in this paper specifically targets the estimation algorithm of the controller: It is found that improved estimation accuracy and thereby enhanced damping performance can be achieved by introducing a prediction-correction scheme for the estimator, in the form of a Kalman Filter. The prediction of the phasor at the next step is performed based on the control signal that is applied at the current step. This enables more precise damping of the targeted mode. The presented results, which are obtained from simulations on a Single-Machine Infinite Bus system and the IEEE 39-Bus system, indicate that the proposed enhancement improves the performance of this type of controller. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The microgrid is an emerging trend in modern power systems. Microgrids consist of controllable power sources, storage, and loads. An elaborate control infrastructure is established to regulate and synchronize the interaction of these components. The control scheme is divided into a hierarchy of several layers, where each layer is composed of multi-agents performing their dedicated functions and arriving at a consensus of corrective values. Lateral and horizontal interaction of such multi-agents forms a comprehensive hierarchical control structure that regulates the microgrid operation to achieve a compendium of objectives, including power sharing, voltage, and frequency regulation. The success of a multi-agent-based control scheme is dependent on the health of the communication media that is used to relay measurements and control signals. Delays in the transmission of control signals result in an overall deterioration of the control performance and non-convergence. This paper proposes novel multi-agent moving average estimators to mitigate the effect of latent communication links and establishes a hierarchical control scheme incorporating these average estimators to accurately arrive at system values during communication delays. Mathematical models are established for the complete microgrid system to test the stability of the proposed method against conventional consensus-based methods. Case-wise simulation studies and lab-scale experi-mental verification further establish the efficacy and superiority of the proposed control scheme in comparison with other conventionally used control methods. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Optical tweezers (OT) have become an essential technique in several fields of physics, chemistry, and biology as precise micromanipulation tools and microscopic force transducers. Quantitative measurements require the accurate calibration of the trap stiffness of the optical trap and the diffusion constant of the optically trapped particle. This is typically done by statistical estimators constructed from the position signal of the particle, which is recorded by a digital camera or a quadrant photodiode. The finite integration time and sampling frequency of the detector need to be properly taken into account. Here, we present a general approach based on the joint probability density function of the sampled trajectory that corrects exactly the biases due to the detector’s finite integration time and limited sampling frequency, providing theoretical formulas for the most widely employed calibration methods: equipartition, mean squared displacement, autocorrelation, power spectral density, and force reconstruction via maximum-likelihood-estimator analysis (FORMA). Our results, tested with experiments and Monte Carlo simulations, will permit users of OT to confidently estimate the trap stiffness and diffusion constant, extending their use to a broader set of experimental conditions. © 2023 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement.},

This article introduces a single-input single-output (SISO) VLC system under the joint effects of statistical random channel and signal-dependent shot noise (SDSN). Moreover, it estimates the channel of the considered system using maximum likelihood (ML), least square (LS), linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE), maximum posteriori probability (MAP) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimators. Furthermore, a Bayesian Cramé-Rao lower bound (BCRLB) is derived for the proposed system and it is compared to the mean square error (MSE) of the proposed estimators. The problem of unknown SDSN factor, ζ 2, at the receiver side is discussed and two solutions are investigated. The receiver of a VLC system under SDSN and random channel gain h is designed and its BER is studied. Finally, Monte Carlo simulation results of the proposed estimators, which show the dramatic effect of the SDSN on the considered system, are provided. In particular, the presence of noise variance, as well as the SDSN factor, causes an increase in the MSE of the system, while increasing the power reinforces the system performance.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With the rapid increase of wind power penetration, the frequency indicators of power system, encompassing frequency deviation and rate of change of frequency (RoCoF), are prone to exceed the pertinent relay thresholds, thus leading to serious power outages. Wind farms can participate in primary frequency regulation (PFR) to alleviate the above problem. However, wind farms reserve capacity (WFRC) presented by overspeed control and pitch angle control is the important factor for frequency safety especially when large disturbance occurs, and it varies obviously in different conditions. Thus, WFRC should be utilized optimally to avoid insufficient or excessive response of wind farms in PFR. To overcome the challenge, this paper proposes frequency-trajectory-oriented control (FTOC) for wind farms based on a two-fold optimization framework, seeking to obtain the best frequency control performances in PFR through realizing the optimal compromise between frequency results and the consumption of WFRC. First, when the frequency indicators deviate significantly from the normal values, the optimal frequency trajectory is planned periodically according to the local standards and operation conditions, thereby minimizing the total consumption of WFRC on the premise of frequency safety. Second, based on model predictive control and a real-time power system parameters estimator, the total reference power of wind farms, which helps the frequency track the latest planned trajectory, is optimally distributed among wind generators according to their reserve capacity. In this case, through the optimal frequency trajectory planning and tracking, the new method in this paper not only effectively prevents the frequency results from exceeding the local standards under diverse conditions, but also finds the optimal balance among frequency indicators safety, frequency trajectory smoothness, and the reserve capacity consumption of wind power generators. Finally, the simulation results prove the effectiveness and advancement of FTOC. © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is very sensitive to the carrier frequency offset (CFO). The CFO estimation precision heavily makes impacts on the OFDM performance. In this paper, a new Bayesian learning-assisted joint CFO tracking and channel impulse response estimation is proposed. The proposed algorithm is modified from a Bayesian learning-assisted estimation (BLAE) algorithm in the literature. The BLAE is expectation-maximization (EM)-based and displays the estimator mean square error (MSE) lower than the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) when the CFO value is near zero. However, its MSE value may increase quickly as the CFO value goes away from zero. Hence, the CFO estimator of the BLAE is replaced to solve the problem. Originally, the design criterion of the single-time-sample (STS) CFO estimator in the literature is maximum likelihood (ML)-based. Its MSE performance can reach the CRB. Also, its CFO estimation range can reach the widest range required for a CFO tracking estimator. For a CFO normalized by the sub-carrier spacing, the widest tracking range required is from -0:5 to +0:5. Here, we apply the STS CFO estimator design method to the EM-based Bayesian learning framework. The resultant Bayesian learning-assisted STS algorithm displays the MSE performance lower than the CRB, and its CFO estimation range is between ±0:5. With such a Bayesian learning design criterion, the additional channel noise power and power delay profile must be estimated, as compared with the ML-based design criterion. With the additional channel statistical information, the derived algorithm presents the MSE performance better than the CRB. Two frequency-selective channels are adopted for computer simulations. One has fixed tap weights, and the other is Rayleigh fading. Comparisons with the most related algorithms are also been provided.  © 2023 The Institute of Electronics.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a method to estimate the inertia constant of synchronous generators (SGs) and the virtual inertia provided by converter-interfaced generators (CIGs). It can be applied when the system is under normal operating conditions or after power imbalance events. The algorithm is based on a recursive system identification approach and uses the active power and bus frequency measurements proceeding from phasor measurement units. The measurements are preprocessed to improve the estimation accuracy. Subsequently, a model-independent rotor speed estimator is used to compute rotor speed variations (or internal frequency variations, in the case of CIGs). Afterwards, a recursive least-square equation error formulation is implemented to compute the SG and CIG parameters in the z-domain, which are later converted into their respective counterparts in the s-domain. The method is applied to several generation devices in the IEEE 39-bus and IEEE 118-bus test systems, including traditional SGs and CIGs providing virtual inertia. Numerical results show the accuracy and the low computational burden of the proposed method. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {State-of-the-art indoor broadband power line communications (PLC) systems use orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals with constellations up to 10 bits/symbol, which makes channel estimation a key aspect. This paper focuses on the initial channel estimation used in the payload, which might be further adapted by means of a decision-directed strategy. This initial estimate has to be computed on a per-frame basis and can be accomplished from the preamble, the header symbol (assuming that it has been correctly decoded) or from a combination of both. This work proposes simple channel estimation techniques for this problem and derives their most appropriate parameters. They are compared with the linear minimum mean squared-error (LMMSE) estimator and others commonly used in wireless scenarios by considering both their performance and computational complexity. The factors limiting the performance of the estimators based on the preamble and the header symbols are analyzed and the implications of the differences between PLC and wireless channels, such as the absence of fading, in the design of estimation techniques that require knowledge of the channel statistics are discussed. A performance analysis of the considered techniques is accomplished in a set of 171 measured indoor PLC channels. Obtained results indicate that estimators from the header perform better than those based on the preamble symbols and we provide a computationally simple estimator that gives nearly optimum performance by combining estimates from both the preamble and the header symbols. © 2023 Korean Institute of Communications and Information Sciences.

	abstract = {With the increasing penetration of inverter-interfaced photovoltaic (PV) systems in AC microgrids, the system inertia is increasingly deficient and the frequency response ancillary service provided by PV systems will be inevitable. In this paper, in order to make the PV systems provide multi-time scale frequency response, a novel distributed event-triggered hierarchical control (DEHC) of PV inverters is proposed, which includes a primary frequency response (PFR) control loop and a secondary frequency response (SFR) control loop. For the PFR, the PV inverters that operate in frequency regulation (FR) mode can arrest the frequency deviation in sub-seconds time-scale by an automatic deloading strategy, which is with low cost and easy to implement as no requirements for a storage system, irradiance sensors, and MPP estimators. For the SFR, the PV inverters that operate in FR mode can respond to the reference instruction assigned by a high-level AGC control center in seconds time-scale based on a novel distributed control strategy, which can converge within a fixed-time that independents to the initial conditions of the system. Furthermore, a novel event-triggered mechanism is designed to reduce the communication costs between PV inverters. Finally, case study results verify the effectiveness and improved performance of the proposed method. © 1969-2012 IEEE.},

The performances of these estimators are compared with the derived Bayesian Cramér-Rao lower bound (BCRLB), which can be used as a benchmark to evaluate the efficiency of the unbiased estimators. The presented analytical results, corroborated with Monte Carlo simulations, indicate that the MMSE estimator provides the best results. Additionally, the increasing number of pilot symbols as well as the ascending transmitted power improve the system performance.

This paper presents a simple and innovative approach for sensor-less vector control of stand-alone Doubly Fed Induction generators (DFIG). Unlike grid-connected DFIG, accurate estimation of speed/position of the rotor is crucial for frequency control of stand-alone DFIG. As a new work, an open-loop flux and speed estimator have been developed for the DFIG application. The advantage of a developed speed/angle estimator is its independency of rotor current sensors, the feature that enhances system robustness. Such as other off-line observers, developed estimators are sensitive to machine parameters. To overcome this problem, particle-swarm-optimization has been practically implemented in a digital-signal-processor for parameter identification. Both simulation and experimental results prove the acceptable performance of the proposed approach, especially in preserving the amplitude and frequency of sinusoidal load voltage. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Harmonic and interharmonic content in power system signals is increasing with the development of renewable energy generation and power electronic devices. These multiple signal components can seriously degrade power quality, trip thermal generators, cause oscillations, and threaten system stability, especially the interharmonic tones with positive damping factors. The first step to mitigate these adverse effects is to accurately and quickly monitor signal features, including frequency, damping factor, amplitude, and phase. This paper proposes a concise and robust index to identify the number of modes present in the signal using the singular values of the Hankel matrix and discusses the scope of its application by testing the influence of various factors. Next, the simplified matrix pencil theory is employed to estimate the signal component frequency and damping factor. Then their estimates are considered in the modified least-squares algorithm to extract the wideband multi-component phasors accurately. Finally, this paper designs a series of scenarios considering varying signal frequency, damping factor, amplitude, and phase to test the proposed algorithm thoroughly. The results verify that the proposed method can achieve a maximum total vector error of less than 1.5%, which is more accurate than existing phasor estimators in various signal environments. The high accuracy of the proposed method is because it considers both the estimation of the frequency number and the effect of signal damping. © 2023 by the authors.},

We present a weather forecasting module for Ka-band communications that is intended to be used in an autonomous network management service that employs machine-to-machine scheduling systems for dynamic user access opportunities. Our forecasting module (NIMBUS) runs on AWS Cloud, consumes the freely and publicly available NOAA MRMS precipitation rate dataset (1km x 1km x 2-min), produces 30-minute Nowcasts using the pySTEPS algorithm, and publishes high-level ground station specific link quality predictions. We evaluate two potential NIMBUS outputs, a binary classifier that predicts rain attenuation greater than 3 dB and a rain attenuation estimator, and we backtest these outputs using one year of power measurement data collected from observations of the geostationary ANIK F2 satellite's Ka-band beacon. We report, with a 30-minute lead time, a binary classifier accuracy of 84% and an estimator RMSE of 1.67 dB. Additionally, we discuss how the NIMBUS module could be incorporated into a user-initiated service framework to enable weather-aware scheduling and reconfiguration. Integrating NIMBUS into a user-initiated service framework provides an alternative to static link budget padding based on a statistical long-term rain exceedance rate attenuation, and leverages advances in software defined radio, autonomous machine-to-machine scheduling, and precipitation Nowcasting. © 2023 IEEE.},

To enhance the insensitivity against measurement outliers, an outlier-resistant SE algorithm is developed with two distinct features: 1) a saturation function is adopted to constrain the innovation term in the state estimator so as to mitigate the negative influences from the outlier-contaminated measuring data; and 2) an upper bound on the estimation error covariance is first ensured and then minimized by selecting proper gain parameters.

	abstract = {A fundamental problem with electrical systems' power quality is electrical harmonics. In order to limit harmonics and their effects on power systems, filters used in electric power systems must be designed with the consideration of power harmonics. The study's suggested approach differs from other hybrid strategies that have been previously published, and the processes that are expected mostly center on cutting down on computing complexity and time. The voltage and current waveforms of distribution networks have started to be significantly distorted over the past 20 years due to the increased use of power electronic equipment and non-linear loads. This paper provides a new hybrid approach for harmonic estimation. Harmonic estimation of these deformed waveforms is a nonlinear problem because sinusoidal waveforms contain nonlinear distortions. As a result, the corresponding combined technique splits the problem of harmonic estimation into two independent problems due to the slow convergence of nonlinear problems in the estimate of harmonic components. The algorithm used in this study first estimates amplitude and frequency using the fuzzy logic control (FLC) approach, a non-linear estimator. The objective function is then to minimize the error value for both the original signal and the estimated signal using the genetic algorithm, a non-linear estimator. The experiments show that the proposed method for determining harmonic estimation time is 36% better than comparable methods. As a result, the suggested technique offers a number of benefits, including very quick computation times, more precise evaluation of amplitude and phase values for all conditions, and complexity in the outcomes. © 2023, Science and Information Organization.

	abstract = {A wide range of utility applications require controllable switches with features such as high-voltage blocking and high-current carrying capacity, especially at high pulse width modulation (PWM) frequency. Low- and medium-voltage utility applications such as motor drives and flexible AC transmission systems as well as solid state transformers could also benefit from a low-cost high-voltage switching module. Wide-bandgap semiconductors such as silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN) metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs) are considered to be the present and next-generation device choices, although they have limitations. For relatively high-voltage applications with demanding thermal management, SiC is still the only choice, and GaN dominates the low-voltage regime. This manuscript proposes a new half-bridge power MOSFET module that is suitable for conventional H-bridge of multilevel configurations used in high-voltage applications. Constructed from bare SiC dies, this half-bridge module takes advantage of (1) optimized MOSFET placement inside the module, (2) customized heat exchanger, manifold, and cooling, (3) integrated gate driver module with pulse width modulation (PWM) over wi-fi to eliminate the need for low-voltage signals, (4) wireless power transfer (WPT)-enabled gate driver and other ancillary circuits, (5) and the option to incorporate an onboard state-of-health (SOH) estimator module.

	abstract = {Bayesian bounds, such as the Ziv–Zakai bound (ZZB), can provide a tight baseline for the performance of estimators or an accurate prediction for the performance limit of radar systems under all signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. However, there exists very limited literature that deals with the explicit bound for joint estimation of multi-parameters in radar systems. In this paper, we employ the thought of Shannon's information theory to propose a tight bound with closed-form expression for joint range and direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation in multiple-input multiple-output radar. Based on the joint a posteriori probability density function, we define range-DOA entropy error (RDEE) as the entropy power of range and DOA. With normalized a posteriori entropies in low and high SNRs, the closed-form approximation for RDEE is derived. The explicit RDEE is comprehensive and captures the effect of the SNR, the number of array elements, and the ratio of the signal bandwidth to the carrier frequency. RDEE is compared with the ZZB by a numerical simulation and the result shows RDEE and ZZB are almost identical in low and high SNRs. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Low-cost sensors and IoT technologies have facilitated the deployment of environmental sensors to collect and analyze various factors, such as soil properties. Due to the lack of electric power networks in many deployment locations, these sensors rely on energy harvesting (EH) systems that use natural energy sources such as solar power. Specifically, solar-powered EH systems benefit from timely obtaining weather information for efficient future energy scheduling. However, obtaining weather information for EH environmental sensors is always challenging, as they are commonly deployed in harsh environments without network access. To address this problem, we present DynaES, a novel energy scheduling method for EH sensors without relying on online weather forecasts. DynaES comprises two components: a DC power gain estimator that predicts future power gain by individually estimating changes in environmental parameters and ensembling them, and a dynamic energy scheduler that distributes energy to sensors based on priority and adjusts sensing intervals and frequency. We evaluate DynaES via simulation-based studies on real-world datasets and compare its performance against state-of-the-art baselines. Evaluation results show that DynaES accurately predicts future energy gain with low estimation errors and enables 1.8× – 4× more frequent sensing operations with shorter sensing intervals while achieving longer operation hours without complete battery drains. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {It has been recently shown that zero padding (ZP)-orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is a promising candidate for 6G wireless systems requiring joint communication and sensing. In this paper, we consider a multiuser uplink scenario where users are separated in power domain, i.e., non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), and use ZP-OFDM signals. The uplink transmission is grant-free and users are allowed to transmit asynchronously. In this setup, we address the problem of time synchronization by estimating the timing offset (TO) of all the users. We propose two non-data-aided (NDA) estimators, i.e., the joint method of moment (JMoM) and the successive moment cancellation (SMC), that employ the periodicity of the second order moment (SoM) of the received samples for TO estimation. Moreover, the coding assisted (CA) version of the proposed estimators, i.e., CA-JMoM and CA-SMC, are developed for the case of short observation samples. We also extend the proposed estimators to multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The effectiveness of the proposed estimators is evaluated in terms of lock-in probability under various practical scenarios. Simulation results show that the JMoM estimator can reach the lock-in probability of one for the moderate range of (Formula presented.) values. While existing NDA TO estimators in the literature either offer low lock-in probability, high computational complexity that prevents them from being employed in MIMO systems, or are designed for single-user scenarios, the proposed estimators in this paper address all of these issues. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Machine tools are for machining a workpiece by a tool. The main components of machine tools are the frame, the power unit, the control and the steering. The position of the tool should be stabilized at the zero position by the control, which is typically a pure feedback control. The power unit realizes the movement of the workpiece. Thereby, large accelerations of the workpiece must be realized in order to increase the economic efficiency. The periodic movement of the workpiece respectively the power unit excites the entire machine tool and ultimately the tool itself resulting in a position error signal containing the frequencies from the movement. Since the motion pattern of the workpiece is customer knowledge, the frequencies it contains are not known in advance. Additionally, the frequencies change over time due to different motion patterns. However, the range in which the frequencies lie is known. In high-precision positioning of machine tools, there are three possibilities to reduce position errors of the tool: reduction of the disturbance causing the errors, optimization of the plant, which is the whole machine tool, or the control. This contribution focuses on the optimization of the control. By adding active disturbance rejection to the existing feedback controller for the tool, the influence of the disturbance on the position error of the tool is reduced. The resulting controller contains a disturbance estimator based on a Kalman filter. Hereby, the system, which shall be estimated, is either modelled as MIMO system or as a decoupled SISO system. A comparison between the SISO and MIMO realization leads to opposing requirements regarding the parameter tuning and the performance. However, the controller reduces the position error in both cases drastically even under the influence of sensor noise and mismatches between the plant and the system included in the filter. In summary, our approach permits us to estimate disturbances evolving from periodic movements of the workpiece and reduce their impact on the position error signal of the tool. This reduction translates directly into improved machine tool overall performance. © 2023 Euspen Headquarters.},

	abstract = {The existing controls of wind turbines (WT) achieve damping provision mainly by active power modulation, which may affect the wind energy harvest. This paper proposes a two-stage control of the grid-forming direct-driven WTs to actively provide damping supports by fully using the WT resources. In stage one, two damping controllers are designed by the reactive power modulation based on the DC voltage synchronization control. The impacts of the control parameters and the operating conditions on the system stability are evaluated. The proposed controllers utilize the reactive power modulation and the DC capacitor energy for its damping provision, while the WT is operated at the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) mode. In the second stage, when the DC voltage fluctuation exceeds the designed threshold, the WT power controller immediately starts, further enhancing the system damping using the WT-side resources. An MPPT recovery process is further designed to eliminate the droop effects induced by the damper. The proposed controller does not require a frequency estimator and the active power modulation for the synchronization purposes between WT and the weak AC grid. Meanwhile, it well resolves the paradox between energy efficiency and providing strong damping support by considering the energy costs. © 2023 Power System Technology Press. All rights reserved.},

It follows the active methodology, in which an intermittent noncharacteristic signal is injected into the dc-link to estimate the equivalent series resistance (ESR) and capacitance (C) of dc-link capacitors. A real-time stationary discrete wavelet packet transform (RT-SDWPT) performs the capacitor parameter estimations. In this scheme, an interharmonic is used as a noncharacteristic signal to prevent the influence of the system's inherent harmonic components, mitigating estimation errors. Moreover, the interharmonic frequency is chosen in the region influenced by the ESR and C parameters to ensure capacitor degradation condition. Besides, to mitigate quality issues, the interharmonic's amplitude, duration, and the time interval between two signal injections follow the recommendations defined by standards. Furthermore, a parameter deviation detection scheme is employed to adaptively adjust the time interval between two estimations, improving failure detection. Experimental results obtained from a microgrid laboratory setup demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

This paper proposes an optimal frequency fault-tolerant control method in the distributed generation system, utilizing adaptive dynamic programming combined with fuzzy critic estimation. First, based on the operational state of the system, a non-linear dynamic model for the virtual synchronous generator is established. Then, considering the occurrence of actuator faults, the fault-tolerant control problem is formulated as an optimal control problem, where a fault observer is designed to estimate the fault signals. Furthermore, the proposed adaptive dynamic programming method based on fuzzy critic estimation is employed to effectively solve the highly coupled nonlinear Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation and ensure the state convergence of the system with uniform ultimate boundedness. The optimal fault-tolerant control law ensures a bounded frequency error for the virtual synchronous generator system in the event of faults. Finally, the effectiveness of the optimal control method is verified by two sets of simulations. © 2023 The Authors.

When it comes to oil thickness estimation, few reliable methods capable of accurately measuring the thickness of thick oil slick (in mm) on top of the sea surface have been advanced. In this article, we provide accurate estimates of oil slick thicknesses using nadir-looking wide-band radar sensors by incorporating both C-and X-frequency bands operating over calm ocean when the weather conditions are suitable for cleaning operations and the wind speed is very low (<3 m/s). We develop Maximum-Likelihood dual-and multi-frequency statistical signal processing algorithms to estimate the thicknesses of spilled oil. The estimators use Minimum-Euclidean-Distance classification problem, in pre-defined multidimensional constellation sets, on radar reflectivity values. Furthermore, to be able to use the algorithms in oil-spill scenarios, we devise and assess the accuracy of a practical iterative procedure to use the proposed 2D and 3D estimators for accurate and reliable thickness estimations in oil-spill scenarios under noisy conditions. Results on simulated and in-lab experimental data show that M-Scan 4D estimators outperform lower-order estimators even when the iterative procedure is applied. This work is a proof that using radar measurements taken from nadir-looking systems, thick oil slick thicknesses up to 10 mm can be accurately estimated. To the best of our knowledge, the radar active sensor has not yet been used to estimate the oil slick thickness. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a promising therapy for treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (MDD). MDD involves the dysfunction of a brain network that can exhibit complex nonlinear neural dynamics in multiple frequency bands. However, current open-loop and responsive DBS methods cannot track the complex multiband neural dynamics in MDD, leading to imprecise regulation of symptoms, variable treatment effects among patients, and high battery power consumption. Methods: Here, we develop a closed-loop brain-computer interface (BCI) system of predictive neuromodulation for treating MDD. We first use a biophysically plausible ventral anterior cingulate cortex (vACC)-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) neural mass model of MDD to simulate nonlinear and multiband neural dynamics in response to DBS. We then use offline system identification to build a dynamic model that predicts the DBS effect on neural activity. We next use the offline identified model to design an online BCI system of predictive neuromodulation. The online BCI system consists of a dynamic brain state estimator and a model predictive controller. The brain state estimator estimates the MDD brain state from the history of neural activity and previously delivered DBS patterns. The predictive controller takes the estimated MDD brain state as the feedback signal and optimally adjusts DBS to regulate the MDD neural dynamics to therapeutic targets. We use the vACC-dlPFC neural mass model as a simulation testbed to test the BCI system and compare it with state-of-the-art open-loop and responsive DBS treatments of MDD. Results: We demonstrate that our dynamic model accurately predicts nonlinear and multiband neural activity. Consequently, the predictive neuromodulation system accurately regulates the neural dynamics in MDD, resulting in significantly smaller control errors and lower DBS battery power consumption than open-loop and responsive DBS. Discussion: Our results have implications for developing future precisely-tailored clinical closed-loop DBS treatments for MDD. Copyright © 2023 Fang and Yang.},

	abstract = {There is a problem of harmonic phasor estimation under out-of-band interference, frequency deviation and other dynamic situations in power systems. Thus a harmonic phasor estimator based on a cosine flat-top window is proposed. First, the window coefficients of the flat-top window are obtained by the ideal amplitude response and the least squares method based on the cosine window frequency domain expression. To obtain a frequency response with zero gain at the nominal harmonic frequency, the obtained window function is combined with the frequency domain sampling theorem. Based on this, a bank of finite impulse response filters is designed by the least squares method, and they are used to estimate the harmonic phasor. Then, the frequency response of the cosine flat-top window and the harmonic phasor measurement filter is analyzed. Finally, the performance of the proposed harmonic phasor estimator is verified by different signal models under steady-state and dynamic conditions. The simulation results show that, compared with the two harmonic phasor estimators based on the Sinc interpolation function and the frequency domain sampling theorem, the proposed method has a stronger ability to suppress out-of-band interference, and more accurate harmonic phasor estimation can be realized under the various conditions. © 2023 Power System Protection and Control Press.

	abstract = {The Industry 4.0 technology relies on Single-board computers and the Internet of Things (IOT) and Machine Learning (ML). In addition, sensory detectors, controllers, and a communication interface are employed to address the demands of distant supervision and operational management. In today's industrial environment, understanding machines and giving effective interpretation and prognostics is a challenging issue. This paper presents an effective on-process identification tool for monitoring and advising the operator based on sensor parameters. The data is analysed with the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) inference and machine learning strategies to detect the production calibre of an industrial Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machine, including vibration, temperature, humidity, and operating temperatures. The vibration parameter is provided to the FFT algorithm to produce frequency, and the diameter dataset is also provided manually from the hole diameter in the job piece to correctly monitor and inspect the product quality to prognostics to the fault in machines. Improper machine settings cause varied vibrations and changes in parameters, whereas our Industry 4.0 module detects and warns about faulty parameters. The device is put through its trials using three distinct machine learning approaches, and the results are collected. ML combines the outcomes of many baseline estimators to provide better results. This research work utilizes the Linear regression model since it has a high-power detection ability and minimizes variance as well as bias. The Single board computer using FFT and linear regression monitoring gives greater data accuracy of 97.6 percent on comparing the outcomes of 5.4%improved efficiency than K-Nearest Neighbourhood (KNN), 95.5% Random Forest Network (RN), and 95% Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms.

	abstract = {A promising approach to avoid the bottleneck of the analog-to-digital converter's (ADCs) high power consumption at high sampling frequencies is to use only 1-bit quantization resolution. By using temporal oversampling at the receiver, a high resolution in the time-domain can be achieved, which can partly recover the losses in terms of rate caused by a reduced amplitude resolution. However, channel estimation and synchronization has to be performed on 1-bit quantized receive samples, which poses a new challenge.This work is concerned with the phase estimation of a 1-bit quantized system with phase noise in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) range. A block-based least squares (LS) estimator, whose output is interpolated by a Kalman filter is presented to track the phase noise. To enhance the performance, especially for the case of a large spacing between pilot blocks, we study the Rauch-Tung-Striebel (RTS) algorithm. Both algorithms are adjusted to the system characteristics and bounds for the steady state performance are derived. These bounds, as well as numerical results show that the RTS algorithm achieves a lower error variance than the Kalman filter at the price of increased latency, as it is non-causal. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The direction-of-arrival (DOA) of acoustic sources is an important parameter used in multichannel acoustic signal processing to perform, e.g., source extraction. Deep learning-based time-frequency masking has been widely used to make DOA estimators signal-aware, i.e., to localize only the sources of interest (SOIs) and disregard other sources. The mask is applied to feature representations of the microphone signals. DOA estimators can either be model-based or deep learning-based, such that the combination with the deep learning-based masking estimator can either be hybrid or fully data-driven. Although fully data-driven systems can be trained end-to-end, existing training losses for hybrid systems like weighted steered-response power require ground-truth microphone signals, i.e., signals containing only the SOIs. In this work, we propose a loss function that enables training hybrid DOA estimation systems end-to-end using the noisy microphone signals and the ground-truth DOAs of the SOIs, and hence does not dependent on the ground-truth signals. We show that weighted steered-response power trained using the proposed loss performs on par with weighted steered-response power trained using an existing loss that depends on the ground-truth microphone signals. End-to-end training yields consistent performance irrespective of the explicit application of phase transform weighting. © 2022 European Signal Processing Conference, EUSIPCO. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In multi-feeder microgrid systems, accurate power sharing and voltage regulation at each load feeder is more challenging than the conventional single-feeder microgrids. This paper presents an enhanced resilient control strategy for multi-feeder micro-network systems by considering the load feeder voltage regulation and power balancing as a quadratic optimization problem. The proposed control strategy is composed of impedance estimator and optimal controller. However, the impedance estimator obtains each load feeder impedance while optimal controller computes the voltage commands for each distributed generator. One of the important aspects of the proposed control scheme is that only the voltage magnitude information is required to transfer at each inverter's controller, with primary aim to achieve the two-fold objectives. This control strategy is also extended to approximate the whole network impedance into solitary load feeder for micro-networks with extensive number of load feeders. This makes the system computationally less burdening. The MATLAB/Simulink and experimental results are obtained under varying load conditions and line parameter uncertainties for radial type multi-feeder microgrid configuration that reflects the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. The verification outcomes prove the proposed method capability of accurate reactive power sharing, regulation of load feeder voltages, and frequency restoration. © 2022},

	abstract = {The nonlinear distortions attributed by radio frequency power amplifiers (PAs) are inevitable in millimeter-wave (mmWave) systems due to the high frequency and large bandwidth. This nonlinearity induces multiplicative distortion and intercarrier interference in mmWave multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing systems, which in collusion with a frequency-selective channel and a carrier frequency offset (CFO) brings great challenges to signal detection. Furthermore, the nonlinearity destroys orthogonality of the training pilots and degrades the estimation accuracy of the channel gains and the CFO. Also, the target posterior distribution for data detection becomes analytically intractable due to the nonlinearity. In this article, we present an importance-sampling-based framework for estimating the CFO in the presence of PA impairment, which utilizes few pilots and initializes the channel estimator. We propose a particle-filter-based iterative algorithm for data detection, where the intractable posterior distribution is approximated by weighted random measures. Furthermore, a sequential-maximum-likelihood-based semiblind channel estimator in the presence of nonlinearity is proposed. Performances of the estimator and the detector are evaluated by means of normalized mean square error, mean square error, and bit error rate. To validate the efficacy of the channel and the CFO estimator, the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) and the weighted Bayesian CRB are derived, respectively.  © 2007-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The frequency of subsynchronous oscillation (SSO) in doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind farms connected to series-compensated networks is determined by system-wide operating conditions, including the wind speed, number of in-service wind turbines, and degree of series-compensation. This paper proposes an adaptive mitigation scheme to damp the SSO for a full range of subsynchronous frequency variations due to different operating conditions. The proposed scheme comprises 1) a subsynchronous frequency estimator (SSFE) and 2) an adaptive subsynchronous damping controller (ASDC). The SSFE detects the SSO mode and tracks its subsynchronous frequency accurately. The ASDC utilizes voltage signals to extract the SSO at the estimated subsynchronous frequency, generates appropriate current signals, and injects them into the grid through a shunt-voltage sourced converter (SVSC). The ASDC behaves like a variable impedance, which essentially reshapes the system's impedance response by adding a positive resistance at the estimated subsynchronous frequency. The parameters of the phase-shifters are computed using Brent's root-finding method such that the desired phase-shift at the estimated subsynchronous frequency is always maintained. The control's adaptiveness and damping performance under different operating scenarios is verified through extensive EMT simulations on a real-world wind power system facing SSO using PSCAD. © 1986-2012 IEEE.},

Various passive ultra-high frequency (UHF) RFID implementations are considered that employ multiple antennas at the reader and single or multiple antennas at each tag. We look at several recent works those explored MIMO for RFID receivers. When using MIMO at the backscatter channel, significant improvements can be achieved in the BER as well as range extension. With the extra reliability and increased throughput, such systems can be deployed in many important applications like large tag reading scenarios and accurate tracking. Increased throughput is directly dependent on estimation of tag quantity in a bulk reading environment and usually estimators designed for single antenna systems under-perform in such settings causing low signal to noise ratio (SNR) when employed in MIMO systems where tag signal overlapping can happen more often. One of the key challenges is to keep the design of the RFID tag simple, cutting cost and power requirement when employing anti-collision schemes. We provide a brief survey in some of the recent developments related to MIMO RFID systems, the protocols and algorithms used, and improvements achieved. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {After asynchronous interconnection, the mixed oscillation of low frequency and ultra-low frequency will appear in the system with high permeability of hydropower units, which will do great harm to the safe and stable operation of power grid. To solve the problem of inaccurate identification of characteristic parameters of mixed oscillation signals, a second-order synchronous extracting wavelet transform (SSEWT) method is proposed, which is combined with empirical envelope (EE) demodulation technology to identify real-time modal parameters of oscillation signals. The SSEWT extends the existing synchronous extraction transform to wavelet transform, and introduces the second-order instantaneous frequency estimator to decompose the signal. Then, combined with EE demodulation technology, the parameters of each group of oscillation components are identified. Finally, the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed method are proved by self-synthesis signal simulation, 10-machine 39-bus system simulation, and measured signal simulation. Compared with empirical mode decomposition (EMD) algorithm and Fourier synchrosqueezed transform transform(FSST) algorithm, the simulation results show that the proposed method can be adopted to effectively suppress noise and endpoint effect, and accurately identify the characteristic parameters of mixed oscillation signals. © 2022 Science Press.

However, it increases the system complexity and vulnerability to cyberattacks that could jeopardize the seamless system operation. The attack must be detected effectively, and then proper measures to mitigate the effect quickly to restore normality. This work implements a reduced-order H∞ filter to simultaneously estimate the state variable and unknown inputs such as noise or attack signals in the automatic generation control (AGC) system. Further, the knowledge of the disturbances is utilized to mitigate the attack by appropriately compensating the sensor readings, such that the control decisions are based on the correct states, not the corrupted signals generated in the attack scenario. The stability criterion is provided based on Lyapunov functions to check the estimation error in the presence of the exogenous disturbance. Further, the proposed H∞ estimator performance is evaluated by comparing it with the Kalman filter to verify its effectiveness. The estimator's performance is validated by developing a cosimulation platform using the server-client architecture of data exchange. Further, the performance is validated in a real-time digital simulator (RTDS) platform used as the power system interacting with an estimator deployed on Raspberry Pi board sensing the attacks.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With the advancement of technology, electric equipment and loads have become more sensitive to problems related to power quality, such as voltage sag, swell, imbalances, and harmonics. To detect faults and to protect sensitive loads from these voltage distortions, a Dynamic Voltage Restorer (DVR) series compensator is among the best available cost-effective solutions. One of the main goals of the DVR is to achieve a control structure that is robust, stable, and can handle properly the disturbances (e.g., grid voltage issues, load current, and fluctuations at the DC link voltage) and model uncertainties (e.g., inverters and filter parameters). In this work, a novel framework control strategy based on Uncertainty and Disturbance Estimator (UDE) is proposed to improve the response of the DVR to properly compensate the load voltage under a variety of power quality issues, particularly the ones associated with the grid voltage disturbances. Additionally, the stability of the proposed control system is analyzed and validated using the Lyapunov stability theory. The advantages of the new control system are robustness, simplified design, good harmonic rejection, low tracking error, fast response, and sinusoidal reference tracking without the need for voltage transformations or specific frequency tuning (e.g., abc-dq0 and Proportional-Resonant). This research uses the MATLAB/Simulink software to validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme under a diverse set of conditions with no control limitations. Moreover, the designed controller is tested under real conditions using Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIL) validation with OPAL-RT real-time simulator coupled with a TI Launchpad microcontroller. The results demonstrate a good performance of the proposed control strategy for a quick transient response and a great harmonic rejection when subject to grid voltage distortions. © 2021 ISA},

Compared to the existing correlation-based method, the proposed CPD method is based on upon a maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for the detection of an unknown number changes in signal mean to unknown levels at unknown times. Using the pruned exact linear time (PELT) dynamic programming algorithm along with a novel refinement technique, the proposed approach is shown to provide a dramatic improvement in FO start/stop time estimation accuracy while being robust to intermittent FOs.

The communication delay is considered to denote the small time delay in a local control area of a wide-area power system. The system is modeled in the state space with inclusion of the delay state matrix parameters. Since some state variables are difficult to measure in a real modern multi-area power system, Kalman filter is used to estimate the unmeasured variables. In addition, the controller with the optimal feedback gain reduces the frequency spikes to zero and keeps the system stable. Lyapunov function based on the linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique is used to re-assure the asymptotically stability and the convergence of the estimator error. The designed LQG is simulated in a two area connected power network with considerable time delay. The result from the simulations indicates that the controller performed with expectation in terms of damping the frequency fluctuations and area control errors. It also solved the limitation of other controllers which need to measure all the system state variables. © 2022 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Increasing penetrations of distributed renewables are decreasing the effectiveness of traditional decentralized under-frequency load shedding (UFLS) schemes. As more distribution circuits begin to back-feed the transmission system, operation of traditional UFLS may exacerbate frequency instability. This paper presents the conceptual framework for a data-rich environment to coordinate UFLS across multiple distribution providers based on the laminar coordination framework in order to ensure optimal adaptive setting of UFLS relays. Communication and control are enabled through a distributed implementation of the IEC 61968-1 Common Information Model message bus structure. In addition to the proposed architecture, a novel adaptive UFLS scheme informed by a bi-level state estimator to create optimal relay setpoints is introduced. Initial simulation results are presented for the IEEE 14-bus test system on scenarios leading to mis-operation of traditional UFLS. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Millimeter-wave (mmWave) RF and analog front-end circuits are very susceptible to chip process and temperature variation, which cause I/Q mismatch and DC offset. As a consequence, the system performance can be seriously degraded, especially in wideband multi-Gb/s systems. This paper proposes an online estimation and compensation in the baseband receiver end of a single carrier (SC) system for TX and RX frequency independent (FI) initial and time-varying (TV) I/Q mismatch and DC-offset. Based on specification of IEEE 802.11ay, the compensated image rejection ratio (IRR) performance of the TX and RX FI I/Q mismatch effects can be improved from 16.43 dB to 54.70 dB at SNR of 25.52 dB. Moreover, we propose a novel algorithm based on the Golay sequence for estimation and compensation to cancel TX and RX initial/TV DC-offset. The DC-offset in the I/Q channel is improved from −56.46 dB/−58.56 dB to −97.30 dB/−98.70 dB at SNR of 25.52 dB. In the hardware implementation, a four-time parallelism architecture are proposed to work at a 625 MHz clock rate with a 28-nm HPC_PLUS CMOS process under 64-QAM mode for 15 Gbps transmission. Using a clock gating control scheme for FI I/Q mismatch and DC-offset estimator, the total power of the proposed the module can be reduced from 59.5 mW to 32.7 mW. The gate count and power of the proposed estimation/compensation design are only 2.94% and 1.69% of the overall digital RX baseband gate count and power consumption. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {A real-time harmonic estimator is proposed to provide a high-accuracy, computationally-efficient, and low-cache-cost solution that can be applied in embedded system for the online monitoring of numerous harmonics in wide frequency band in electronic power systems. Firstly, the fast-tuning filter bank, named FT-TFT FB, is presented, which can be fast generated by straightforwardly tuning the pseudo inverse of the basic single-frequency Taylor-Fourier basis matrix using the frequency-related diagonal weight matrix. Secondly, the robust FT-TFT estimator, named RFT-TFT, is proposed by estimating harmonics using the FT-TFT FB with a fast bias compensation process. It is verified using the numerical test that RFT-TFT estimator can achieve the same high accuracy as iterative TFT (I-TFT) estimator under steady and dynamic conditions but be much faster than I-TFT. The online application feasibility is further verified by implementing RFT-TFT estimator in C6748 DSP-based embedded prototype. Finally, this prototype is applied for the field signal analysis of ±800 kV Ultra HVDC transmission system and the real-time harmonic monitoring of one 0.3 MW distributed photovoltaic (PV) system, respectively.  © 2010-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Previous theoretical studies have identified possible conditions for an undetectable false data injection attack (FDIA) vector that bypasses bad data detectors in power system state estimators. The formulation of the FDIA vector has attracted many researchers to propose detection algorithms. However, neither the attack formulation nor the proposed detection algorithms have been experimentally proven or validated. In this article, a framework for developing cybersecurity test beds that evaluate FDIA vectors for utility-scale distributed energy resources (DERs) and SE in real-time is proposed and implemented. The test bed is a combination of: 1) simulation models of utility-scale DER and distribution systems using OPAL-RT; 2) intelligent electronic devices (SEL-351S, SEL-311C, and SEL-3355); 3) network devices; and 4) graphical user interface (LabVIEW). The combination of actual devices, modeled systems, and cyber-physical interfaces adds realistic constraints, such as sampling error, network jitter, and data time alignment that exist during actual power system operations. Using the test bed framework, results show that the onset of the FDIA against a state estimator is experimentally detectable. Next, the test bed is used to expose an unknown vulnerability of existing phase-locked loop (PLL) techniques by presenting a new class of attack that causes PLL reporting of false phase angle and frequency values to the DER controllers. This type of attack would, then, induce the DERs to perform an adverse control action. In this article, a new detection algorithm based on a Kalman filter is evaluated to detect this type of PLL attack. A detailed evaluation of various attack scenarios is presented. The results indicate the benefits of employing this type of test bed framework to improve the development of cybersecurity defenses for realistic inverter-based DER environments.  © 2021 IEEE.},

In this paper, we are pioneering to propose the knowledge-driven machine learning (KDML) model to exhibit that knowledge can play an important role in machine learning tasks. Compared with conventional machine learning, KDML contains a unique knowledge module based on specific domain knowledge, which is able to simplify the machine learning network structures, reduce the training overhead and improve interpretability. Channel estimation problem of wireless communication is taken as a case verification because such machine learning-based solutions face huge challenges in terms of accuracy, complexity, and reliability. We integrate the classical wireless channel estimation algorithms into different machine learning neural networks and propose KDML-based channel estimators in Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) and Massive Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) system. The experimental results in both communication systems validate the effectiveness of the proposed KDML-based channel estimators.  © 2015 IEEE.},

The proposed speed estimator is designed based on the sliding mode observer (SMO) technique, which makes the estimation algorithm robust under parametric variations and external disturbances. The position of the rotor is computed directly by the integration of the estimated speed by the designed observer. The proposed observer requires the measurements of stator voltage and current to estimate the speed. The design procedure of the observer does not require the mechanical parameters of the DFIG, which makes the observer design independent of the mechanical parameters. Lyapunov stability criteria are used to formulate the sliding gains for the observer. Simulation and experimental results are demonstrated to show the efficacy of the designed observer in terms of accuracy and convergence rate under different steady-state and dynamic conditions.

However, the current network planning technique limitation has constrained the real potential of mobile digital connectivity development. This situation has hindered sustainable Internet-oriented economic and technological development. The 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP), through its specification release 18 (Rel.18), has included and leveraged the potential capabilities of machine learning (ML) technologies in advanced mobile network planning. The main objective is to enhance mobile network planning performance and reduce complexity. To materialize this aim, we propose a novel ML-based Online coverage Estimator (MLOE) tool developed based on Random Forest (RF) ML algorithm. It uses seven unique features to predict the mobile network performance through reference signal received power (RSRP). Accordingly, the results showed that MLOE outperformed traditional empirical techniques and previous works. The final trained RF algorithm has achieved an outstanding root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.65 dB and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.93. With the dynamic and fast-growing mobile technology, MLOE has been deployed on an online platform using MATLAB® Web App Server, which offers a modular and scalable architecture.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Deadbeat model predictive control (DB-MPC) is one of the advanced promising control methods for power converters thanks to its simplicity, high steady-state performance and fast dynamic response. However, the high sensitivity to parameter mismatch and the difficulty of handling multiple control targets are problematic issues in DB-MPC. This work presents an improved robust DB-MPC for a new nine-level ANPC-based inverter. This inverter requires a low number of power devices compared to other single dc-source inverters. Only nine active switches and two discrete diodes are utilized to obtain a nine-level waveform. Without the need for weighting factors, the proposed DB-MPC method tackles three control goals; current control, flying capacitors (FCs) stabilization and dc-link balance, which saves the laborious effort of adjusting the weighting factors in the traditional finite control set MPC (FCS-MPC) method. Moreover, an effective dc-link balancing scheme based on power flow control is proposed and integrated into the FCs control objective. To enhance the control robustness, an EKF-based estimator is designed to identify the system parameters online. In addition, the proposed DB-MPC scheme allows the considered inverter to continue operating with the generation of five levels in the failure condition of the four-quadrant switch, improving the fault tolerance of the inverter. The developed DB-MPC method is experimentally verified in steady-state and transient operation. To demonstrate the excellent performance of the presented DB-MPC scheme, experimental comparisons with other popular MPC methods are performed.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The objective measurement of muscle fatigue through the analysis of surface electromyographic signals (S-EMG) has been the object of study in recent decades. The use of S-EMG is interesting because it allows accessing the muscular structure and function through the use of a noninvasive technique. This is a subject of interest to many areas of science such as clinical and orthopedic medicine, biomechanics, physiotherapy and rehabilitation, telemedicine, control of interfaces, intelligent prosthetics, and exoskeletons control and for expert systems to support medical diagnosis to neuromuscular diseases. Changes in the spectral signature of the S-EMG signal such as spectral shift for low frequencies and the increase in the dynamic range of the signal indicate the installation of the biological phenomenon of fatigue. For instance, classical techniques such as zero-crossing, median frequency (MDF), and mean power frequency (MPF) are able to perceive the spectral shift in S-EMG signals. On the other hand, techniques such as root mean square (RMS) values can only perceive the variation in the dynamic range of the S-EMG signal. Methods: In this work, new mathematical models for the objective assessment of muscle fatigue are presented. We sought to design models for objective fatigue estimators that simultaneously perceive the spectral shift for low frequencies and the increase in the dynamic range in the S-EMG signal during the instauration of the fatigue process. The new approach is integrated to the weighted-cumulated methodology framework previously proposed. Three new objective muscle fatigue estimators were conceived: the scalable weighted-cumulated Fourier estimator, the weighted-cumulated wavelet estimator (SWCW), and the weighted-cumulated p-side lobe attenuation algorithm (p-SL). Results: To evaluate the proposed tools based on the scalable weighted-cumulated methodology, we investigated two dynamic protocols with muscle fatigue production. The S-EMG signals recorded from the biceps brachii and from the vastus lateralis were used. The results obtained with the application of the new proposed objective fatigue estimators are shown. The results are discussed and compared with the weighted-cumulated models. Conclusions: The scalable fatigue estimators exhibited an experimental behavior consistent with the assumptions on which they were designed. The results have been promising. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Brazilian Society of Biomedical Engineering.},

	abstract = {Fast and accurate fault location in DC power systems is of particular importance to ensure their reliable operation. One of the approaches for implementing a fast-tripping protection scheme is to use Traveling waves (TW) initiated by a fault scenario. This paper proposes a physics-informed machine learning approach that utilizes TWs for fault location in DC microgrids. TWs are extracted by the so-called multiresolution analysis which identifies the TW's wavelet coefficients for multiple frequency ranges. This paper deploys Parseval's theorem to find the energy of wavelet coefficients as a quantitative metric for describing TWs. The hypothesis of this paper is that once the Parseval energy curves for a specific cable are extracted, they can be utilized to locate faults along with that cable regardless of the DC system in which the cable is deployed. The fault location algorithm uses Parseval energy curves to train a Gaussian Process (GP) estimator. With the Parseval energy values of measured current at the protection device location, the GP estimator is able to estimate fault locations with high accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified by simulating a DC microgrid system in PSCAD/EMTDC. © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {NASA is responding to the growing interest in, and capabilities of, small satellites for science applications with an increasing number and frequency of Announcements of Opportunity for small satellite space missions. Estimating the probability that these mission concepts will fit within the small cost caps of these opportunities is largely driven by the probability that one of the burgeoning number of small satellite providers will be able to meet the payload's accommodation requirements within the budget for the spacecraft. JPL has collected a database containing technical specifications and cost of commercially available Smallsat buses across various vendors. The primary purpose of the database is for use in JPL's Team X architecture studies to inform cost estimates of a spacecraft bus which fits the customer's technical requirements for their payload and mission. Customer needs are often unique and don't align perfectly with an off-the-shelf commercial spacecraft bus, which motivates the need to develop a cost model across the continuous technical parameter space. Al's Bus Cost Distribution Estimator (ABCDE) uses Gaussian process regression (GPR) to predict commercial Smallsat spacecraft bus cost based on a subset of a customer's technical requirements (payload mass, payload power, delta V, pointing control, and downlink rate). GPR is implemented in ABCDE as a Bayesian method which fits an implied multivariate regression on the technical parameters and uses kriging to intentionally 'overfit' the residuals. Overfitting the residuals allows cost estimates to collapse in uncertainty closer to the data points while maintaining larger uncertainty intervals in regions of parameter space with fewer data records. The data used to fit this model is sensitive and represents cost estimates for off-the-shelf commercial buses. GPR simultaneously protects the sensitivity of the database and uses the sparse nature of the database to account for uncertainty in cost in a useful way. For a given set of customer technical requirements, the tool provides a cost estimate distribution, the percentiles of which can be interpreted as a confidence level of finding a commercial bus under a specified cost cap. ABCDE dramatically pushes the boundaries of spacecraft cost estimation models due to its Bayesian methodology (accounting for the maximum uncertainty in the underlying regression), the mathematically advanced kriging methodology, and the novelty of its application in Team X architecture trade studies. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a single-stage grid-connected three-phase photovoltaic inverter feeding power to the grid. Using the Recursive Least Squares (RLS) Estimator, an online grid impedance technique is proposed in the stationary reference frame. The method iteratively estimates the grid resistance and inductance values and is effective in detecting inverter islanding according to IEEE standard 929-2000. An Adaptive Feedforward Neural (AFN) Controller has also been developed using the inverse of the system to improve the performance of the inner-loop Proportional-Integral controllers under dynamical conditions and provide better DC link voltage stability. The neural network weights are computed in real-time using the controller sample time, making the system highly compliant to abrupt changes in grid conditions. Additionally, the proposed controller significantly improves reference tracking ability when subjected to variations in irradiation and temperature. The current control technique proposed results in better control approaches for microgrids, energy storage systems, variable frequency drives, and distributed generation. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In this work, we propose variations of a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) based channel estimator that was recently proven to be asymptotically optimal in the minimum mean square error (MMSE) sense. We account for the need of low computational complexity in the online estimation and low cost for training and storage in practical applications. To this end, we discuss modifications of the underlying expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, which is needed to fit the parameters of the GMM, to allow for structurally constrained covariances. Further, we investigate splitting the 2D time and frequency estimation problem in wideband systems into cascaded 1D estimations with the help of the GMM. The proposed cascaded GMM approach drastically reduces the complexity and memory requirements. We observe that due to the training on realistic channel data, the proposed GMM estimators seem to inherently perform a trade-off between saving complexity/parameters and estimation performance. We compare these low-complexity approaches to a practical and low cost method that relies on the power delay profile (PDP) and the Doppler spectrum (DS). We argue that, with the training on scenario-specific data from the environment, these practical baselines are outperformed by far with equal estimation complexity.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With the increasing penetration of photovoltaic (PV) in microgrid, the problem of insufficient frequency regulation capabilities is becoming more and more serious, the traditional frequency regulation scheme that only relies on energy storage is featured with high investment and maintenance costs. To improve the frequency stability of microgrid system and reduce the dependence on energy storage, it is urgent to study the joint frequency regulation strategy based on PV and energy storage system. Therefore, this paper proposes a fuzzy adaptive sliding mode control strategy for the PV system and a fuzzy adaptive control strategy for the energy storage system, so that the PV system and the energy storage system can cooperatively participate in the frequency regulation of the microgrid. For the PV fuzzy adaptive sliding mode control of the PV system, the sliding mode surface function is firstly designed according to the PV power-voltage characteristic curve, and then the adaptive sliding mode surface compensation is designed to provide adaptive power reserve for regulating the frequency of a microgrid in both the up and down directions. For the fuzzy adaptive control strategy of the energy storage system, the power control loop and current control loop are firstly designed, and then the adaptive charging and discharging power control strategy is designed to collaboratively participate in the frequency regulation of the microgrid according to the frequency deviation. The designed control strategy has the advantages of no requirements of a maximum power estimator, irradiance sensors, communication devices, and detailed PV models. Simulation results based on IEEE 13 bus microgrid test system demonstrate that, under high PV penetration, by the proposed control strategy under fluctuations in load or irradiance the maximum frequency deviation caused by the load or irradiance fluctuates is reduced by 2.84%~23.24% compared to the result by the traditional droop control, is reduced by 6.14%~11.99% compared to the result by no energy storage control strategy,and is reduced by 21.42%~58.14% compared to the result by the maximum power point control strategy. The research results can provide reference for frequency regulation of new power system with high renewable energy penetration. © 2022 Authors. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Over-the-air precision two-way time transfer and ranging (PTTR) uses the signals exchanged between two RF transceivers to estimate the range between them and the offset between their clocks. Our paper makes three significant contributions to the estimation and position, navigation, and timing literature. First, we introduce a propagation channel model characterized by its amplitude (attenuation), phase shift, and propagation delay. This three-parameter formulation is quite practical for modeling signal exchange over line-of-sight channels with arbitrary additive wide-sense stationary noise that also captures electronic effects. Second, we derive the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for this three parameter channel model. We show that there is a canonical definition of phase shift for which the CRLB is a diagonal matrix. The derived CRLB depends on simple properties of the signal and noise power spectral density (PSD) related to whitened bandwidth and whitened center frequency as well as the signal to noise ratio. Third, we derive a maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for the amplitude, phase shift, and delay given the reference waveform, received waveform samples, and noise PSD. A novel aspect of the derived MLE is that it is implemented entirely in the frequency domain, which makes the MLE more computationally efficient than a typical time-domain implementation. Using an example reference waveform, we show that the derived MLE achieves an empirical covariance close to the CRLB for sufficiently high signal to noise ratios. The estimation results of our paper are directly relevant to over-the-air PTTR applications operating in direct-path, line-of-sight propagation environments. The generality of the waveform and noise formulations allow our estimator and bounds to be applied to arbitrary PTTR ranging waveforms in colored interference environments. We present a system architecture utilizing this estimator that enables PTTR on existing wireless networks with no changes to the communications protocol or radio hardware or software. © 2022 IEEE.},

This spectral efficiency loss can be avoided using superimposed pilots, where delay-Doppler (DD) bins in the OTFS frame carries both data and pilot symbols. In this paper, we propose a sparse superimposed pilot scheme for channel estimation, where all the DD bins in a frame carry data symbols and pilot symbols are superimposed over some of them, sparsely. The proposed scheme does not suffer spectral efficiency loss due to pilot/guard symbols. It also has the advantage of more localized pilot-data interference profile that leads to better performance. We derive the minimum mean square error (MMSE) channel estimator for the proposed scheme. We obtain optimum number of pilot symbols per frame and power distribution among data and pilot symbols through simulations. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves better performance at a lesser complexity compared to existing superimposed pilot scheme. An iterative scheme that further improves performance is also proposed.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {A new approach to the estimation and classification of nonlinear frequency modulated (NLFM) signals is presented in the paper. These problems are crucial in electronic reconnaissance systems whose role is to indicate what signals are being received and recognized by the intercepting receiver. NLFM signals offer a variety of useful properties not available for signals with linear frequency modulation (LFM). In particular, NLFM signals can ensure the desired reduction of sidelobes of an autocorrelation (AC) function and desired power spectral density (PSD); therefore, such signals are more frequently used in modern radar and echolocation systems. Due to their nonlinear properties, the discussed signals are difficult to recognize and therefore require sophisticated methods of analysis, estimation and classification. NLFM signals with frequency content varying with time are mainly analyzed by time–frequency algorithms. However, the methods presented in the paper belong to time–chirp domain, which is relatively rarely cited in the literature. It is proposed to use polynomial approximations of nonlinear frequency and phase functions describing signals. This allows for applying the cubic phase function (CPF) as an estimator of phase polynomial coefficients. Originally, the CPF involved only third-order nonlinearities of the phase function. The extension of the CPF using nonuniform sampling is used to analyse the higher order polynomial phase. In this paper, a sixth order polynomial is considered. It is proposed to estimate the instantaneous frequency using a polynomial with coefficients calculated from the coefficients of the phase polynomial obtained by CPF. The determined coefficients also constitute the set of distinctive features for a classification task. The proposed CPF-based classification method was examined for three common NLFM signals and one LFM signal. Two types of neural network classifiers: learning vector quantization (LVQ) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) are considered for such defined classification problem. The performance of both the estimation and classification processes was analyzed using Monte Carlo simulation studies for different SNRs. The results of the simulation research revealed good estimation performance and error-free classification for the SNR range encountered in practical applications. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Integrating intermittent wind power into power systems results in low or zero inertia, threatening their frequency stability. To accommodate intermittent generations, the demand response (DR) is introduced, and air conditioning loads (ACs) account for an increasing proportion of all loads. The replacement of traditional generators with wind turbines and the ACs user uncertainties produce parameter uncertainties. This paper aims to construct an equivalent input disturbance (EID)-based load frequency control (LFC) strategy for the power system by considering wind power and ACs. First, an open-loop model is constructed for the LFC scheme with parameter uncertainties. Then, the parameter uncertainties and external disturbance are lumped into a fictitious disturbance, which is estimated using an EID estimator. By incorporating the estimation of disturbance into the control input, the disturbance-rejection performance is achieved. Next, the Lyapunov theory is used to derive the two linear-matrix-inequality-based asymptotic stability criteria. A design algorithm is developed for the EID-based LFC scheme by exploiting an overall performance evaluation index. Finally, simulation results for the single-area and two-area LFC schemes show that, compared with the existing approaches, the method presented realizes the better disturbance rejection and higher robustness against parameter uncertainties, wind power fluctuation, and tie-line power changes. Additionally, its robustness to time delays is verified. © 2022, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

Therefore, set-based testing methods that jointly assess the effects of groups of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were developed to increase the powers of the association tests. However, these powers are still insufficient, and precise estimations of the effect sizes of individual SNPs are largely impossible. In this article, we provide an efficient set-based statistical inference framework that addresses both of these important issues simultaneously using an empirical Bayes method with semiparametric multilevel mixture modeling. We propose to utilize the hierarchical model that incorporates variations in set-specific effects and to apply the optimal discovery procedure (ODP) that achieves the largest overall power in multiple significance testing. In addition, we provide an optimal “set-based” estimator of the empirical distribution of effect sizes. The efficiency of the proposed methods is demonstrated through application to a genome-wide association study of coronary artery disease and through simulation studies. The results demonstrated numerous rare variants with large effect sizes for coronary artery disease, and the number of significant sets detected by the ODP was much greater than those identified by existing methods. © 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.},

	abstract = {Conventionally, the benchmark proportional-integral control method is implemented to realize power factor correction and output voltage regulation of single-phase ac/dc converters. However, the performance is deteriorated due to the influence of uncertainties and disturbances, e.g., periodic input voltage and load variation. Concerning this problem, this article proposes a model-free control (MFC) strategy of single-phase ac/dc converters. The MFC principle is revisited and a frequency response analysis is presented for the algebraic estimators of uncertainties and disturbances. Consequently, the closed-loop performance of MFC systems is allowed to be analyzed in frequency domain via classical linear control theory. Based on the theoretical results, the model-free current and voltage control systems are synthesized in detail to achieve control objectives of the converter. Simulation results demonstrate the performance of MFC systems in reference tracking and disturbance rejection. The feasibility and validity of the presented MFC strategy for single-phase boost ac/dc converters is also confirmed experimentally as compared to the benchmark scheme.  © 1986-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Robustness and performance are key properties that can contribute to the widespread dissemination of fuel cell systems (FCSs) as power sources, and a precise output voltage can serve as a reliable criterion to evaluate these properties. In this paper, we propose to utilize intentional time delays as part of controllers to achieve proper output voltage regulation in an FCS. In the past few years, there has been a growing interest toward designing controllers with intentional delays to render improved responses and better noise attenuation capabilities in various classes of systems and this investigation extends the use of delay-based controllers to the application field of FCSs. A natural progression of this research, which to our knowledge has not been addressed, pertains to how such controllers perform in the presence of uncertainties, and whether or not these controllers can accommodate these uncertainties. In this research work, we present a solution to this open problem on a class of proportional integral retarded (PIR) controllers when controlling an FCS supplying a time-varying uncertain load. Through stability theory, the safe operation of the PIR controlled FCS is systematically guaranteed in spite of uncertain loads and input voltages. Specifically, based on Lyapunov methods and (Formula presented.) -gain analysis, we derive simple stability conditions to achieve robustness and (Formula presented.) performance. We show that utilizing only output voltage measurements the PIR controller can maintain the predictive features of a pure differentiator, but without its inherent noise amplification problems. Hence, low-pass filtering of signals or reconstruction of the states can be obviated. Compared with published control schemes for FCSs, the PIR controller is structurally simpler and practically realizable, and it is able to maintain robustness against uncertain loads and (Formula presented.) performance under exogenous signals without relying on disturbance estimators. Numerical simulations confirm the superiority of the PIR controller over benchmark proportional integral and proportional integral derivative controllers in terms of robustness, performance and noise attenuation capabilities. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {Crude oil price predictability has continually been considered as a fundamental argument of finance literature, given its critical propositions for risk management, investment decisions, and commercial and financial policymaking. This work presents an innovative learning framework for efficient predictive modeling of daily and weekly crude oil price (COP) information, which aims to enable sustainable management in oil markets. Firstly, an optimized version of variation mode decomposition (OVMD) is proposed to adaptively decompose the original COP time series into multiple modes based on a set of optimized parameters calculated with a Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) algorithm. Secondly, an AdaBoost algorithm is redesigned using random forest (RF) to model the future price information in the modes with the high frequency. Thirdly, a new deep network is presented to develop automatically learn spatial–temporal representations from decomposed COP data, where a novel Conv-former module is designed to efficiently extract local as well as global spatial representations without incurring extra computational costs. Followingly, Multiple Long short-term Memory (LSTM) networks are stacked to learn temporal representations from input modes. To further empower the representation power of our framework, a new bidirectional learning module is presented to stack the LSTM layer to learn from COP data in the forward and backward directions. To validate the efficiency of the proposed framework, this work performs experimental simulations and analyses based on a case study from Brent crude oil prices at both daily and weekly scales. The experimental findings show up the competent predictive modeling capabilities of the proposed framework over the cutting-edge methods rendering it as a promising solution to enable sustainable management in crude oil markets. The proposed framework can be generalized to different predictive modeling tasks and hence qualified to be used as a valuable tool for oil portfolio creation, property pricing, and risk management in Crude Oil Markets. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This article addresses the measurement of the power spectrum of red noise processes at the lowest frequencies, where the minimum acquisition time is so long that it is impossible to average on a sequence of data record. Therefore, averaging is possible only on simultaneous observation of multiple instruments. This is the case of radio astronomy, which we take as the paradigm, but examples may be found in other fields such as climatology and geodesy. We compare the Bayesian confidence interval of the red noise parameter using two estimators, the spectrum average and the cross-spectrum. While the spectrum average is widely used, the cross-spectrum using multiple instruments is rather uncommon. With two instruments, the cross-spectrum estimator leads to the Variance-Gamma distribution. A generalization to q devices based on the Fourier transform of characteristic functions is provided, with the example of the observation of millisecond pulsars with five radio telescopes (RTs). The simulations show that the spectrum average is by a small amount more efficient than the cross-spectrum, chiefly when the background exceeds the signal. However, some notable differences between their upper limit indicate that it should be wiser to compute both estimators.  © 1986-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In recent years, vehicular communication has attracted significant research attention for its potential as a fifth generation (5G) application. The IEEE 802.11p standard enables the wireless technology that defines vehicular communication and, due to the time-varying characteristic, one of its critical challenges is to ensure communication reliability. Moreover, this standard is based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) transmission scheme, which may suffer from nonlinear distortions induced by high power amplifiers (HPA) at the transmitter, degrading the channel estimation and detection performance of the receivers. In this work, the application of deep learning (DL) based channel estimation schemes to the IEEE 802.11p standard in presence of HPA distortions is presented. Simulation results show that the deep neural network (DNN) based estimation schemes outperform conventional data-pilot aided (DPA) and spectral temporal averaging (STA) estimators in terms of bit error rate and normalized mean squared error, evidencing their superiority in providing reliable estimation in mobility scenarios in presence of HPA nonlinear distortions. Furthermore, the hybrid solution, employing a joint DNN-based post-processing and conventional estimation, achieves less computational complexity than the DL-based proposal on top of the initial DPA estimation. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Problems arising from the different operating conditions of the Electric Power System make essential the studies in the area of signal processing applied to digital protection. Generators and transformers are subject to extensive damage, which occurs during faults or improper system operations. These conditions must be quickly identified and eliminated. Thus, the ANSI 24 function is used to protect transformers and generators against overexcitation, where its actuation is given by the percentage value of the Volts/Hertz ratio. Considering that the frequency is one of the parameters used by the referred relay, it can be concluded that the computational tool used to estimate the frequency directly influences the performance of this relay. Thus, this work aims to demonstrate the behavior of function 24 using different frequency estimation methods published in the specialized literature. So, a test system was implemented in the ATPDraw software, in order to simulate overexcitation events. The voltage signal generated in the simulations were processed by the frequency estimators and by the Volts/Hz digital relay logic, which were implemented in Matlab® software. Finally, the results obtained allowed to conclude that, as expected, the frequency estimators directly influence the performance of function 24, causing delays in the operation, as well as the non-functioning or inadequate operation of the Volts/Hertz relays.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Positioning with cellular signals has been gaining attention in urban and indoor environments, where global navigation satellite system signals have limited availability due to interference, blockage, or multipath. However, accurate and reliable tracking of cellular signals under highly dynamic urban channel conditions remains a challenging task. This article presents a cellular long-term evolution (LTE) signal tracking algorithm implemented by an adaptive multipath estimating delay lock loop (AMEDLL) to achieve carrier phase synchronization and time-of-arrival (TOA) tracking under severe multipath propagation conditions. The analytical expression of the coherently integrated correlation result over multiple slots with the LTE cell-specific reference signal is derived. A multipath estimator along with a simple yet efficient multipath estimation monitoring approach is developed to estimate the parameters of all detected multipath signals. Several heuristic monitoring criteria based on historical multipath parameter estimations are established to enable adaptive adjustment of the estimated path number. Real LTE signals are collected in an urban environment for the signal tracking performance evaluation. This article presents two case studies with varying levels of multipath effects and signal power to illustrate the effectiveness of the developed signal tracking algorithm. Instead of a TOA truth reference, open-loop carrier phase estimations are used to analyze the TOA tracking error. Our analyses demonstrate that the AMEDLL-based tracking algorithm provides improved TOA estimation accuracy over the existing super-resolution-algorithm-based and delay-lock-loop-based tracking schemes.  © 1965-2011 IEEE.},

	abstract = {A modern power grid is a cyber-physical system, which are vulnerable to cyber attacks. A recently found attack, the time-delay switch attack (TDSA), is made by inserting time delays into communication channels. A TDSA can be highly destructive to a power system as it can lead to instability. This paper presents a novel model predictive control (MPC) for fast frequency controller in a power system which can effectively mitigate the unknown TDSA. The MPC recently has received great attentions to be applied as FFC in a power system. Most of the MPC design are based on discrete-time model, whose future plant behaviour is calculated through iteration, rather than convolution. Nevertheless, one crucial step in the derivation of discrete-time MPC (DTMPC) is to capture the control trajectory over a finite prediction horizon. This imposes a challenge in designing a DTMPC to counteract the time-delay with unknown time length. Thus, a continuous-time MPC (CTMPC) is proposed to deal with TDSA. To overcome the unknown time delay, we synthesize an accurate time-delay estimator and sequential state predictor (SSP), are designed to accurately estimate and effectively counteract the unknown and random TDSA. All presented case studies are based on a real Taipower system and justification of the effectiveness of the proposed method was verified. © 2013 IEEE.},

The Extended Kalman filter (EKF) is a suitable estimator for such dynamics, but its implementation tends to be complex and possibly unstable when tracking high-dimensional graph signals. To tackle this, we propose the graph signal processing (GSP)-EKF, which replaces the Kalman gain in the EKF with a graph filter that aims to minimize the computed prediction error. The resulting structure of the GSP-EKF Kalman gain increases the numerical stability and reduces the computational burden compared with the standard EKF, particularly when dealing with bandlimited graph processes. We show that for a measurement model with orthogonal graph frequencies, the GSP-EKF coincides with the EKF. The GSP-EKF is evaluated for graph signal tracking in power system state estimation. It is shown that in this case, the proposed GSP-EKF 1) attains the EKF under the accurate model; and 2) outperforms the EKF under a model mismatch, while being notably less complex in both cases. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In hands-free telephony and other distant-talking applications, an acoustic echo cancellation system is typically required, where a short adaptive filter is often used in practice to achieve fast convergence at low computational cost. This may result in late residual echo (LRE) remaining due to under-modeling of the echo path and early residual echo (ERE) due to filter misalignment. Both residual echo components can be suppressed using a postfilter in the subband domain, which requires accurate estimates of the power spectral density (PSD) of the ERE and LRE components. State-of-the-art methods estimate the ERE and LRE PSDs independently of each other, where the ERE PSD is estimated by simply multiplying the loudspeaker PSD with a frequency-dependent scalar and the LRE PSD is estimated using a recursive estimator based on frequency-dependent reverberation scaling and decay parameters. In this paper, we propose to extend the ERE PSD estimator from a scalar to a moving average filter on the loudspeaker PSD. In addition, we propose a signal-based method to jointly estimate all model parameters for the ERE and LRE PSD estimators in online mode, and derive two gradient-descent-based algorithms to simultaneously update the model parameters by minimizing the mean squared log error. The proposed method is compared with state-of-the-art methods in terms of estimation accuracy of the model parameters as well as the residual echo PSDs. Simulation results using both artificially generated as well as measured impulse responses show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods for all considered scenarios.  © 2014 IEEE.},

Such a problem is particularly important for electric utility grid-connected power electronic converters. This article utilizes a linear regression model of the signal to solve this interesting practical problem. A continuous-time dynamic regressor extension and mixing (DREM) based approach is then applied for parameter estimation. For practical implementation, continuous-time estimators are discretized using implicit and explicit Euler methods. We then prove that the implicit discretization can achieve fixed-time convergence for the unknown frequencies estimation. Thanks to the estimated frequencies, another DREM-based linear regression problem is solved for the parameter estimation purpose. The overall order of the proposed technique is the same as the number of unknown parameters, making the estimator suitable for real-time implementation in embedded devices.

In particular, this chapter has focused on the analysis of spectral leakage as it represents the most relevant source of uncertainty when using the DFT to estimate the parameters of a sinusoidal signal. This aspect is of importance in SE processes since they usually adopt relatively short windows to reduce the PMU measurement reporting latencies and RTs. This chapter has also presented state-of-the-art SE algorithms belonging to the family of IpDFT estimators. This chapter has discussed both the classical IpDFT as well as its iterative counterpart (i-IpDFT) capable of dealing with the compensation of the effects of the self-interaction between the positive and the negative images of the spectrum. Such a technique has demonstrated to improve the classical IpDFT performances during both static and dynamic conditions described in the IEEE Std. C37.118 and to be immune to the instantaneous frequency variations of a power system. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the i-IpDFT technique outperforms classical IpDFT methods, also by adopting shorter windows (up to two periods) that are usually worsening the estimation uncertainty of any SE algorithm. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2022.},

	abstract = {The side effects and complications of traditional treatments for treating pathological tremor have led to a growing research interest in wearable tremor suppression devices (WTSDs) as an alternative approach. Similar to how the human brain coordinates the function of the human system, a tremor estimator determines how a WTSD functions. Although many tremor estimation algorithms have been developed and validated, whether they can be implemented on a cost-effective embedded system has not been studied; furthermore, their effectiveness on tremor signals with multiple harmonics has not been investigated. Therefore, in this study, four tremor estimators were implemented, evaluated, and compared: Weighted-frequency Fourier Linear Combiner (WFLC), WFLC-based Kalman Filter (WFLC-KF), Band-limited Multiple FLC, and enhanced High-order WFLC-KF (eHWFLC-KF). This study aimed to evaluate the performance of each algorithm on a bench-top tremor suppression system with 18 recorded tremor motion datasets; and compare the performance of each estimator. The experimental evaluation showed that the eHWFLC-KF-based WTSD achieved the best performance when suppressing tremor with an average of 89.3% reduction in tremor power, and an average error when tracking voluntary motion of 6.6°/s. Statistical analysis indicated that the eHWFLC-KF-based WTSD is able to reduce the power of tremor better than the WFLC and WFLC-KF, and the BMFLC-based WTSD is better than the WFLC. The performance when tracking voluntary motion is similar among all systems. This study has proven the feasibility of implementing various tremor estimators in a cost-effective embedded system, and provided a real-time performance assessment of four tremor estimators.  © 2001-2011 IEEE.},

This method utilizes the available input voltage and current signals to predict the output DC link voltage.

We aim to minimize the power consumption at a sensor node by reflecting the supplied power signal from an access point (AP), which is called backscatter communication. Moreover, by adopting the frequency-shifted modulation technique during backscatter transmission, full-duplex communication is performed between the AP and the sensor node. However, this incurs a problem that the uplink and downlink channels are cascaded, which results in degrading the performance of beamforming. In order to overcome this problem, we propose a novel channel estimation method that extracts separate uplink and downlink channels from the cascaded channels. We formulate the problem for joint channel estimation and pilot optimization, and then design the DL based channel estimator, which is composed of feedforward neural network(FNN) and convolutional neural network(CNN), for compensating nonlinearity and non-convexity. Finally, we analyze the performance of the proposed DL based channel estimator compared to the conventional channel estimator.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {High data rate system is the most prominent version of communication systems require for the fifth generation mobile systems. Visible light communication (VLC) is one of the options to achieve the objective. Visible light communication works in the range of 400-700 THz and allows lower interference with radio frequency (RF) counterpart. However, VLC deployment suffers from some serious issues which can be overcome by the hybrid RF/VLC system. These hybrid systems provide promising mechanism for the problem in hand. Data rate maximizing can be done by constraining bandwidth, power, and user connection. We can opt for joint optimization of bandwidth, power, and user connection to maximize the data rate is non-concave and obtaining an optimal solution is hard with conventional algorithms. Normally, one optimization variable is presumed in the existing algorithms. A joint mechanism will be discussed in this chapter for hybrid RF/VLC systems. Basically, deep Q-network (DQN) learning-based algorithm is used in this chapter, which is an efficient learning-based mechanism for optimization. Multiple access points (APs) of VLC systems and only one RF AP will be taken. Idle APs are used and incorporated, and DQN algorithm is applied by finding an policy with action-value function. To carry out the simulation, a large data set has been taken with a multi-layered network to approximate the action-value function estimator. At the end, a algorithm has been proposed on transfer learning to maximize the data rate for new entered user equipments (UE). This system uses the reacquired data from already installed UE to learn and transfer the the information to new UE. It is aimed to provide an improvement in sum rate and number of iterations by 10 and 50 folds, respectively, as compared to the existing optimization algorithms. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2022.},

We design a novel and theoretically-proved state estimator for an unmanned aerial vehicle with a cable-suspended load based on stability theory. The asymptotical convergence of our system is proved by the Lyapunov theory. The visual-inertial estimation algorithm, which we propose, consumes lower computation power compared with the optimization-based methods and provides high-frequency state estimation for the system. Several Gazebo-based simulations are performed to verify that the proposed algorithm is better than one state-of-the-art visual-inertial-based algorithm.

The signal model is improved and closed-form Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) are calculated for delay and Doppler frequency estimations in attendance of practical clutter, and target's scatterings models. The calculated closed-form CRLBs are simplified to extract the effect of assigned powers to the transmitters for using power allocation (PA) strategies. The maximum likelihood estimation error variances (MLEEVs) are derived for calculated CRLBs' verifications. Four power allocation strategies are defined as mathematical optimization problems that consider the power budget constraints and measurement error statistics as the objective function or constraints.

	abstract = {This paper proposes an enhanced three-layer predictive hierarchical power management framework for secure and economic operation of islanded microgrids. The tertiary control, guaranteeing the microgrid economic operation, is built upon the semi-definite programming-based AC optimal power flow model, which periodically sends power references to secondary control. To mitigate uncertainties arising from renewable generations and loads, a centralized linear model predictive control (MPC) controller is proposed and implemented for secondary control. The MPC controller can effectively regulate the microgrid system frequency by closely tracking reference signals from the tertiary controller with low computational complexity. Droop-based primary controllers are implemented to coordinate with the secondary MPC controller to balance the system in real time. Both synchronous generators (SGs) and solar photovoltaics (PVs) are simulated in the microgrid power management framework. A unified linear input-state estimator (ULISE) is proposed for SG state variable estimation and control anomaly detection due to compromised cyber-physical system components, etc. Simulation results demonstrated that SG states can be accurately estimated, while inconsistency in control signals can be effectively detected for an enhanced MPC. Furthermore, comparing with conventional proportional-integral (PI) control, the proposed hierarchical power management scheme exhibits superior frequency regulation capability whilst maintaining lower system operating costs. © 2021 The Authors.

	abstract = {The power-delay profile (PDP) estimation of wireless channels is an important step to generate a channel correlation matrix for channel linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimation. Estimated channel frequency response can be used to obtain time dispersion characteristics that can be exploited by adaptive orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. In this paper, a joint estimator for PDP and LMMSE channel estimation is proposed. For LMMSE channel estimation, we apply a candidate set of frequency-domain channel correlation functions (CCF) and select the one that best matches the current channel to construct the channel correlation matrix. The initial candidate set is generated based on the traditional CCF calculation method for different scenarios. Then, the result of channel estimation is used as an input for the PDP estimation whereas the estimated PDP is further used to update the candidate channel correlation matrix. The enhancement of LMMSE channel estimation and PDP estimation can be achieved by the iterative joint estimation procedure. Analysis and simulation results show that in different communication scenarios, the PDP estimation error of the proposed method can approach the Cramér–Rao lower bound (CRLB) after a finite number of iterations. Moreover, the mean square error of channel estimation is close to the performance of accurate PDP-assisted LMMSE. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {This study focuses on the time-varying modal frequency identification of space solar power satellites. Accordingly, an improved recursive subspace identification algorithm based on the variable forgetting factor is proposed to enhance the tracking adaptability of the original method in time-varying systems. Considering the changes in the structural configuration induced by the rotation of the solar concentrator mirror, a time-varying attitude-vibration coupling dynamic model of a space solar power satellite with an integrated symmetrical concentrator configuration is developed based on the modal synthesis technology and the substructure method. Moreover, based on the projection subspace theory, the time-varying forgetting factor is determined by minimizing the mean square deviation of the system estimator. Subsequently, the variable forgetting factor subspace algorithm is adopted to recursively identify the time-varying pseudo modal frequency parameters. A finite element model of the space solar power satellite is established via numerical simulations, and several optimal sensor placement methods are applied to determine the positions of the vibration sensors. Based on the output signals obtained from the optimal sensor placement results, the time-varying frequency parameters of the system are obtained using the proposed algorithm. The computational results reveal that a decrease in the average relative error by 4.2% compared with that obtained via the conventional recursive subspace method is observed when the signal-to-noise-ratio of the measured output is selected as 15 dB. In addition, the results also reveal that an average relative error reduction of approximately 0.4%–1.4%, over two other methods with a fixed forgetting factor, can be achieved using the proposed algorithm when the rotation speed of the solar concentrator mirror is increased. The findings of this study confirm that the proposed algorithm demonstrates a high noise-immune ability and tracking performance for fast time-varying systems. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS},

	abstract = {Geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) are referred to as the quasi-dc current flows in power networks, driven by complex space weather-related phenomena. Such currents are a potential threat to the power delivery capability of electrical grids. To mitigate the detrimental impacts of GICs on critical infrastructures, the GICs should be monitored in power systems. Being inherently dc from the power frequency point of view, the components of GICs are, however, challenging and costly to monitor in ac power grids. This article puts forward a novel methodology for the real-time estimation of GICs in power transformers. Such aim is attained by means of an extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based approach, mounted on the nonlinear state-space model of the transformer, whose parameters can be derived from standard tests. The proposed EKF-based algorithm employs the available measurements for the transformer differential protection. The proposed approach, relying on the differential current, can properly deal with the external sources of interference like harmonic excitation and loading. The EKF-based estimator presented is validated by simulation and experimental data. The results verify the ability of the proposed approach to robustly estimate the GIC level during various operating conditions.  © 2021 IEEE.},

A two-level control structure is developed, including 1) the central-level grid-side inductor current control and zero-sequence voltage control; and 2) the local-level per-phase power module control of VF-CSS model predictive controller with state estimator. Two VF-CSS controllers are proposed, including variable-continuous-frequency critical-soft-switching controller and variable-discrete-frequency critical-soft-switching, to achieve critical soft-switching operation for high efficiency. The combination of MPC and VF-CSS guarantees a complete critical soft-switching operation at full period range of varying frequency and especially during transient. The state estimator provides sampling noise rejection and accurate switch-side inductor current estimations for MPC and VF-CSS. Also, with the help of state estimator, the current sensor cost is reduced by 50%. Meanwhile, the estimator contributes to a more accurate switch-side inductor current reading for MPC implementation with variable continuous frequency controller, especially when the critical soft switching requires huge inductor current ripple. With the proposed control strategies and topology, medium-frequency (> 200 kHz, 45 μ H) and high-frequency (> 1 MHz, 4.5 μ H) test benches are validated experimentally. The efficiency is above 99% at a rated power of 15 kW. A power density of more than 10.4 kW/L is achieved.  © 1986-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the design and modeling of a controller applied to a battery charger. The battery charger topology is composed of two stages: the Power Factor Compensation stage and the isolated DC-DC power supply. The first one consists of a boost-rectifier stage connected to the grid and is based on Full-bridge topology; the second stage is an isolated DC-DC power supply associated with the battery charging. The last is composed of three main components, an inverter that generates high-frequency AC to induce a magnetic field of a transformer; the transformer provides galvanic isolation to the battery side, and a bridge rectifier connected to the batteries. Both stages are linked by a capacitor which in turn acts as the output of the PFC boost-rectifier stage and behaves as a constant input source to the DC conversion stage. Thus, the proposed control law consists of three main loops. The current control loop aims to guarantee a power factor close to the unity. The DC voltage mode control loop is intended to regulate the DC capacitor voltage. And, the battery charging control loop is intended to assure proper battery charging. For the last, the constant-current and constant-voltage charging profiles are considered. Besides, adaptive estimators are considered to deal with parametric uncertainties of the input impedance. Finally, numerical results are obtained to evaluate the proposed control law.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Isolated microgrids (MGs) face challenges in performance stability and active/reactive power sharing as a result of frequency/voltage deviations and mismatched line impedance issues. In this paper, a consensus-based multiagent system (MAS) is proposed as a solution to restore voltage/frequency deviations and enable true power sharing. The invention of an Intelligent Distributed Secondary Control Scheme (IDSCS) can efficiently achieve hoped-for outcomes. The proposed IDSCS features estimation and compensation sublayers. For the estimation sublayer, discrete dynamic consensus algorithm-based state estimators are presented to collect average information of frequency, voltage, and reactive power. Each DG is viewed as an agent sharing information with its immediate neighbors through a sparse cyber communication network. In the compensation sublayer, online tuned proportional integral (PI) controllers using artificial neural networks (ANNs) are proposed as an intelligent voltage and frequency compensators. This combination uses the simplicity of the PI controller mathematical formula and ANN’s ability to deal with parameter variations and nonlinearity. Due to the global nature of the frequency parameter, the active power-sharing compensator is unnecessary. For compensating reactive power deviations, ANNs-based reactive power controllers are proposed. Furthermore, at the primary control level, the proposed strategy employs discrete-time proportional resonant (PR) controllers in a stationary reference frame, eliminating the need for any α β / d q or d q / α β transformations. Distributed implementation of the proposed method guarantees system scalability without MG topology or demand pattern expertise. The control scheme was validated using hypothetical MAS in MATLAB Simulink platform. The simulation findings indicate the proposed MG system can effectively distribute power among the DGs while maintaining voltage and frequency stable. Copyright © 2023 Ali M. Jasim et al.},

	abstract = {Accurate state estimation is critical to wide-area situational awareness of smart grid. However, recent research found that power system state estimators are vulnerable to a new type of cyber-attack, called false data injection attack (FDIA). In order to ensure the security of power system operation and control, a hybrid FDIA detection mechanism utilizing temporal correlation is proposed. The proposed mechanism combines Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) technology and machine learning. For the purpose of identifying the features of FDIA, VMD is used to decompose the system state time series into an ensemble of components with different frequencies. Furthermore, due to the lack of online model updating ability in a traditional extreme learning machine, an OS-extreme learning machine (OS-ELM) which has sequential learning ability is used as a detector for identifying FDIA. The proposed detection mechanism is evaluated on the IEEE-14 bus system using real load data from an independent system operator in New York. Apart from detection accuracy, the impact of attack intensity and environment noise on the performance of the proposed method are tested. The simulation results demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of our method.  © 2015 CSEE.},

The path loss (PL), angular spread, interuser spatial correlation, and capacity of a massive MIMO framework are analyzed at the 3.5-GHz frequency band through a measurement campaign inside a subway tunnel to implement the latest 5G standards. The radio channel consists of a uniform rectangular array of 32 transmitting elements and a uniform cylindrical array of 64 receiving elements with horizontal and vertical polarizations. The power ratio of the DMCs is found to be distance dependent, as the DMCs and SMCs behave differently in tunnels. Moreover, the study shows that the channel capacity, angular spread, and DS are reduced as the distance between the transmitting and receiving antenna arrays increases, whereas the PL exponent increases with the distance.

	abstract = {A second-order generalized integrator (SOGI) is a resonant regulator with a pair of complex-conjugate poles, and therefore, with infinite magnitude at its center frequency. Thanks to this property, one can put together a set of m SOGIs in an elegant way and decompose a single-phase signal into its constituent frequency components and detect their amplitude and phase angle. Such a configuration, which is often referred to as the multi-SOGI (MSOGI) structure, requires a frequency estimator to adapt the center frequency of SOGIs to frequency changes. This frequency estimation is often provided by interconnecting the MSOGI structure with a basic frequency-locked loop (FLL) or phase-locked loop (PLL). The resulting structures are known as the MSOGI-FLL and MSOGI-PLL. These structures and their close variants are mathematically difficult to analyze probably because of the lack of a linear model for these systems. This article aims to bridge this research gap. First, it is shown how linear time-periodic (LTP) models of the MSOGI-FLL and MSOGI-PLL can be obtained. The model verification, obtaining open-loop harmonic transfer function from the LTP model, and LTP stability assessment of MSOGI-based synchronization systems are the next parts of this article. Finally, some close variants of the MSOGI-FLL/PLL are considered and their modeling and stability assessment are briefly discussed.  © 1986-2012 IEEE.},

Recent research efforts have sought to formalize the first presumption of the detection of UV communications. This effort seeks to begin the study of the localization of UV communication sources after they are detected. We focus here exclusively on the range estimation problem. Using a phenomenon relating UV received power and range over short-to-medium distances (« 1 km), we develop a range estimator using only the received signal strength. The approach does not require information about other system or environmental parameters. We also theoretically study the performance of the estimator using the Cramér-Rao bound, via simulations, and using previously collected data.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {For industrial application of load monitoring techniques, it is important to establish high-performance state estimators of low-cost and low frequency smart meters (SM) and sensors in a power system, which can run under resource-constrained computing units. Because household electronic appliances often tap power from fixed sockets, a finite state table for the corresponding sensors is suitable and convenient. However, SM in the main line may have an enormous state table. In this study, we propose a belief propagation (BP) algorithm to calculate the power consumption of electronic appliances in a semi-intrusive load monitoring (SILM) system whose SM and sensors have state tables with sizes varying largely. The novelty of the proposed method lies in a continuous approximation to a large state table and a switching scheme between discrete and continuous parts of the SILM system. With datasets from numerical simulations and a real-world experimental SILM system in a set of high-density school buildings within a secondary distribution network, the proposed BP algorithm is compared with relevant state-of-the-art algorithms. The results show that the proposed algorithm achieves a percentage of error (8%), which outperforms the percentage achieved by the other methods, a linear state estimation of 99%, a hidden Markov model of 21%, and a full-discrete BP algorithm of 11%. In addition, the complexity of the proposed algorithm is the least of all methods, and the proposed algorithm can run by SoC on concentrators.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The paper’s main aim is to forecast the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in the USA and its related components, analysing the contributions of each of those components to CO2 total volume. The empirical ground is a mix of non-linear tools, combining the artificial neural network (ANN) parametric method with a vector autoregressive (VAR) estimator. ANN includes 1 layer and 20 neurons, forecasting being based on the economic growth and net trade effects doubled by different types of renewable energy consumption. The accuracy of estimations for 14 targeted categories of CO2 emissions is ensured by 4360 observations, with 10 types of inputs over 1984M01–2020M04. ANN seems to offer superior forecasting accuracy compared with the widely used autoregressive methods, such as VAR model, but seems to be weak in capturing the output ‘spike’ forms. The main findings show that, although economic growth and net trade have an important contribution to the targeted outputs, the more prominent ones are wind, solar and total biomass energy consumption. Therefore, the CO2 emissions can be better controlled through non-polluting capacities, in parallel with the use of wind, solar and total biomass energies. The tool excellently predicts the CO2 emissions during pandemic crises being a good instrument in policy decisions. Modest contributions to CO2 prediction seem to have energy consumption generated by waste, hydroelectric power and renewable geothermal systems. This underlines an unclear current status given their collateral effects in environmental damages and high investment costs. The paper contributes to the literature in several ways. It is one of the first works focused on CO2 emissions forecasting in the USA based on a mixed approach by ANN and VAR types, considering an extended pallet of inputs to predict the volume of total CO2 emissions but also its components. As a novelty, the inputs combine both economic and environmental determinants. Not at least, the estimations are performed based on a large span, with monthly frequency. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {SporTran is a Python utility designed to estimate generic transport coefficients in extended systems, based on the Green-Kubo theory of linear response and the recently introduced cepstral analysis of the current time series generated by molecular dynamics simulations. SporTran can be applied to univariate as well as multivariate time series. Cepstral analysis requires minimum discretion from the user, in that it weakly depends on two parameters, one of which is automatically estimated by a statistical model-selection criterion that univocally determines the resulting accuracy. In order to facilitate the optimal refinement of these parameters, SporTran features an easy-to-use graphical user interface. A command-line interface and a Python API, easy to embed in complex data-analysis workflows, are also provided. Program summary: Program Title: SporTran CPC Library link to program files: https://doi.org/10.17632/hm48f8kgj9.1 Licensing provisions: GPLv3 Programming language: Python Nature of problem: Given an M-variate time series, Jj(t), j=0,…M−1, typically describing a number of currents resulting from a molecular-dynamics simulation, SporTran estimates the transport coefficient κ=1/(Λ−1)00, where Λij=∫0∞〈Jj(t)Jk(0)〉dt is the matrix of the Onsager linear-response coefficients, and 〈⋅〉 indicates an equilibrium average over initial conditions. Solution method: i) It is first observed that the Onsager transport coefficients are the zero-frequency values of the cross power spectra of the currents under scrutiny: Λij=[Formula presented]Sij(ω=0), where Sij(ω)=∫−∞∞〈Ji(t)Jj(0)〉eiωtdt. ii) We next define the (cross) periodogram as the product of pairs of Fourier transforms of the current time series: Skij=[Formula presented]J˜kiJ˜kj⁎, where ϵ is the time step of the time series, N the number of their terms, and J˜kj=∑n=0N−1Jnje2πi[Formula presented] their discrete Fourier transforms, and Jnj=Jj(ϵn). iii) As the current time series are realisations of a Gaussian process, in the long-time limit and for k≠k′ the Skij are uncorrelated complex Wishart random matrices (a matrix generalisation of the χ2 distribution) whose expectation, according to the Wiener-Khintchine theorem, is the cross power spectrum we are after. It follows that (Sk−1)00 is proportional to a set of uncorrelated χ2 deviates; iv) A consistent estimator for log⁡(κ)=−log⁡((Λ−1)00) is finally obtained by applying a low-pass filter to the process log⁡((Sk−1)00).

	abstract = {Vehicular communications are an important focus of studies for 5G applications and beyond. However, in a scenario with doubly-selective and highly variable channel characteristics, tracking the wireless channel to ensure communication reliability is one of the main goals to provide communication efficiency. Moreover, multicarrier modulation schemes usually employed in these scenarios are susceptible to nonlinear distortions caused by high power amplifiers (HPA) at the transmitter, impairing the channel estimation and detection capability of the receivers. In view of these requirements and challenges, in the present work we propose a low complexity estimator based on the long short-term memory (LSTM) network, followed by a neural network (NN) in order to improve the data-pilot aided (DPA) estimation. In addition, we propose a new technique to exploit the characteristics of the vehicular channel, by sampling the subcarriers used at the input of the LSTM. Thus, besides tracking the variations of the wireless channel, the LSTM network is also used to interpolate the channel estimates for all subcarriers. The simulation results show the superiority of the proposed scheme in comparison with other state-of-the-art schemes, especially in high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. Furthermore, the proposed scheme significantly reduces the computational complexity due to the subcarrier sampling procedure.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {To provide significant energy saving in the air and water supply systems, centrifugal fans/pumps are driven by variable frequency induction motor drives. To reduce the cost of the required energy saving close loop control, the necessary expensive flow rate or pressure (head) sensors can be replaced by estimators based on the monitored variables of the drives and imbedded into the drives' software. Available estimation techniques are based on the steady state experimental or data sheet fans'/pumps' curves which is justified by quasi-steady modelling of the fans and pumps. The present paper identifies the problem of this approach during transients. It develops quasi-steady and dynamical estimators for the flow rate and pressure of a centrifugal fan with induction motor drive based on the neural networks trained based on the steady state and transient experimental data. It uses the referred frequency of the stator voltages, the measured rms stator current and the estimated input active power of the motor as inputs of the estimators avoiding the velocity estimation as in the available approaches. It demonstrates better dynamical performance of the dynamical estimators with one sample time delayed feedback as the additional input which is justified by dynamical modelling of the fans/pumps.

	abstract = {This paper proposes fully decentralized l1 optimal dynamic state estimators (DSEs) for load frequency control (LFC) of interconnected power generating systems and provides its comparative and extensive study with respect to three other types of DSEs. To this end, we present the dynamic model of a single area of the power-generating unit occurring from the interconnected power systems. By noting the fact that each area is affected by the frequency deviations in other areas, and it is quite difficult to obtain any property of the load changes in power systems, we characterize the disturbances in the LFC of power systems as bounded persistent signals. As a candidate for DSEs for LFC of power systems, the unknown input observer (UIO), Kalman filter (KF), and H∞ optimal DSE are considered, and their limitations are analyzed in depth. In connection with this, the l1 optimal DSE, in which the maximum magnitude of estimation error for the worst bounded persistent disturbances is minimized, is proposed as the most effective state estimator. Finally, the practical validity and effectiveness of the proposed l1 optimal DSE are demonstrated through some comparative simulations for a three-area power generating system.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In this article, we consider the problem of recovering random graph signals with complex values. For general Bayesian estimation of complex-valued vectors, it is known that the widely-linear minimum mean-squared-error (WLMMSE) estimator can achieve a lower mean-squared-error (MSE) than that of the linear minimum MSE (LMMSE) estimator for the estimation of improper complex-valued signals. Inspired by the WLMMSE estimator, in this article we develop the graph signal processing (GSP)-WLMMSE estimator, which minimizes the MSE among estimators that are represented as a two-channel output of a graph filter, i.e. widely-linear GSP estimators. We discuss the properties of the proposed GSP-WLMMSE estimator. In particular, we show that the MSE of the GSP-WLMMSE estimator is always equal to or lower than the MSE of the GSP-LMMSE estimator. The GSP-WLMMSE estimator is based on diagonal covariance matrices in the graph frequency domain, and thus has reduced complexity compared with the WLMMSE estimator. This property is especially important when using the sample-mean versions of these estimators that are based on a training dataset. We state conditions under which the low-complexity GSP-WLMMSE estimator coincides with the WLMMSE estimator. In simulations, we investigate a synthetic linear estimation problem and the nonlinear problem of state estimation in power systems. For these problems, it is shown that the GSP-WLMMSE estimator outperforms the GSP-LMMSE estimator and achieves similar performance to that of the WLMMSE estimator. Moreover, the sample-mean version of the GSP-WLMMSE estimator outperforms the sample-mean WLMMSE estimator for a limited training dataset and is more robust to topology changes.  © 1991-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Channel Estimation is one of the essential tasks to realize a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) communication system. Compared with conventional systems, the RIS introduces a cascaded channel with high dimension and sophisticated statistics. In this case, it is infeasible to derive the optimal minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator. Additionally, the analytical channel estimators, e.g., the least square (LS) estimator and the linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimator are computational costly and imprecise for practical RIS-aided systems. To address these challenge problems and accurately estimate the channel in an RIS-aided OFDM system, we model the channel estimation as a super-resolution (SR) and image restoration (IR) problem to recover the channel matrix from estimated channel at pilot positions. A convolutional neural network based on super-resolution convolutional neural network (SRCNN) and denoising convolutional neural network (DnCNN), named SRDnNet, is then proposed. The simulation results show that the performance of the proposed SRDnNet outperforms the state-of-the-art deep learning-based estimation methods and the LMMSE estimator. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In structural dynamics, the consideration of statistical uncertainties is imperative to ensure a realistic modelling of loading and material parameters. It is well-known that any deterministic analysis only constitutes a single result for the given input parameters. Because of aleatoric or epistemic uncertainties, many factors must be considered either in certain intervals or with subjective probabilities. Especially for environmental processes, such as earthquakes or wind loads, a reliable prediction of future event characteristics is important for the design of safe structures. This work attends to the statistical procedure of simulating the response behaviour of a dynamic system under an excitation described by a stochastic process. A versatile option for this procedure is the estimation of the Power Spectral Density (PSD) function from real data records. The PSD function determines dominant frequencies and their magnitude of influence on the stochastic process. There are numerous methods for estimating the PSD function from source data, but usually these estimators do not account for uncertainties inherent in data records as they have a rigorous mathematical relationship between data and estimated PSD function. To address this issue, an approach for a stochastic load model that captures epistemic uncertainties by encompassing inherent statistical differences that exist across real data sets is proposed. Due to an increase in available data, reliable statistical information can be extracted from an ensemble of similar PSD functions that differ, for instance, only slightly in shape and peak frequency. Based on these statistics, a PSD function model is derived utilising subjective probabilities to capture the epistemic uncertainties and represent this information effectively. The spectral densities are characterised as random variables instead of employing discrete values, and thus the PSD function itself represents a non-stationary random process comprising a range of possible valid PSD functions for a given data set. This novel representation is useable for producing non-ergodic process realisations immediately applicable for Monte Carlo simulation analyses. The strengths and advantages are demonstrated by means of numerical examples. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

The frequency error introduced by the MTFIR filter is analyzed, and optimal MTFIR filter parameters are accordingly selected to achieve the smallest frequency error. Performance tests show that the proposed MTFIR filter estimator is more accurate than the conventional FIR filter, the interpolated discrete Fourier transform, and the P-class harmonic phasor estimator in HFO magnitude and frequency estimation.

	abstract = {This paper proposes an online decentralized and data-driven method for synchronous generator rotor speed and inertia estimation. First, an analytical relationship between the generator terminal voltage/current phasors and its internal rotor speed is derived using the Thevenin equivalent. The parameters of the latter are obtained via a recursive estimator, which allows us to estimate the generator's internal rotor speed from voltage/current phasors without the need for any generator information. Second, we reformulate the equivalent swing equation into the Kalman filter form, which enables us to use a priori-estimated internal rotor speed along with measured real and reactive power injections to obtain an estimate of the inertia for each online synchronous generator. This is achieved through an adaptive unscented Kalman filter. We demonstrate that the use of terminal bus frequency to approximate the rotor speed for inertia estimation by existing methods leads to large estimation biases/errors. Numerical simulations carried out on the IEEE 39-bus and Texas 2000-bus systems reveal that our proposed method is consistently more accurate than existing methods. Moreover, our proposed method is insensitive to both the type and location of system disturbances, and it is robust to different levels of measurement noise. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

Channel estimation is important for coherent data detection in practical scenarios. This paper investigates estimate power, Mean Square Error (MSE) and Bit Error Rate (BER) parameter metrics with channel estimation algorithm for Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and Rayleigh fading channel on three test environments proposed by International Telecommunication Union (ITU) specified standard model. Simulation output shows that for an AWGN channel, an improvement of approximately 1 dB and 0.3 dB power is obtained with Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) estimate and Least Square (LS)-linear/Spline using DFT. Additionally, for various interpolations employed, MSE decreases as Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) rises, and performance improvement in BER when compared to traditional LS/MMSE estimators also occurs. For Rayleigh fading channel also there arises an enhanced performance in the parameter metrics with MMSE-DFT compared to conventional estimators. In summary, simulation output shows that incorporating DFT algorithm can provide better estimate power, BER and MSE by eliminating the effect of noise externally the extreme channel delay length.  © 2023 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

	abstract = {With the increase of photovoltaic (PV) generation in microgrid, the frequency response capability of system decrease continuously, it is urgent to participate in frequency regulation of PV generation system and energy storage system. Therefore, a fuzzy adaptive sliding mode control strategy for PV system and a droop control strategy for the energy storage system is proposed for making the PV system and the energy storage system cooperatively participate in frequency regulation of the microgrid. For the PV fuzzy adaptive sliding mode control of the PV system, the sliding mode surface function is firstly designed according to the PV power-voltage characteristic curve, and then the adaptive sliding mode surface compensation is designed to provide adaptive power reserve for regulating frequency of microgrid in both the up and down directions. For the droop control strategy of the energy storage system, the current control loop and power control loop are designed, and the adaptive charging and discharging power control strategy is designed to collaboratively participate in the frequency regulation of the microgrid by frequency deviation. The control strategy is designed that has some advantages. It doesn't need maximum power estimators, irradiance sensors, communication devices, and detailed PV models. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed control strategy can effectively suppress the bidirectional frequency fluctuation of the microgrid.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The fundamental frequency of power system may deviate from the nominal value due to various reasons, such as load variation, subsynchronous resonance and fault occurrence. The maximum frequency deviation considered by the latest IEEE standard is 5 Hz. This paper proposes a dynamic harmonic synchrophasor estimator, which can accurately estimate the dynamic harmonic parameters even if the frequency deviation reaches 5 Hz. Multiple discrete frequencies are generated at a fixed frequency interval on both sides of the nominal frequency, and multiple dynamic harmonic filters are generated offline based on those frequencies. The windowed interpolation discrete Fourier transform is adopted for online monitoring of the fundamental frequency. According to the detected frequency, a harmonic filter, which is generated with the discrete frequency that is closest to the detected frequency, can be selected to analyze the dynamic harmonic synchrophasor, frequency and rate of change of frequency. The performances of the proposed estimator are verified through tests under various frequency deviation conditions, and the test results show that the proposed estimator can accurately estimate the dynamic harmonic parameters when the frequency deviation is within 5 Hz. © 2021 IEEE.},

Thanks to the deployed Volterra integral operator and suitably designed kernel-functions, the proposed estimator can achieve very fast convergence speed without compromising the robustness against noise. Therefore, the real-time estimates are able to follow the time-varying frequency and its rate of change with satisfactory accuracy. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method are verified by numerical experiments considering typical practical scenarios under the disturbance of noise.

We study whether energy market participants can rely on low-frequency volatility estimators when interested in two market risks: volatility and expected shortfall. Using ten years of data on four of the world's most liquid energy futures contracts – the crude oil benchmarks West Texas Intermediate and Brent, as well as natural gas and heating oil futures – we provide conclusive evidence that while realized volatility models lead to much more accurate forecasts in the short term, medium- and longer-term forecasts based on daily ranges are comparable and, in some cases, even more accurate than their high-frequency counterparts that are computationally more intensive and that require costly data. Next, we present an application to predict extreme price declines - expected shortfall - with low-frequency volatility estimates. For that purpose, we propose a novel complete subset quantile regression model to predict multiple-day-ahead expected shortfall. Our back-testing results show that the new model leads to well-specified price decline forecasts, particularly when used with low-frequency volatility estimates. These results show that depending on the forecast horizon and purpose, low-frequency, publicly available, free of cost and easy to process volatility estimators still matter. © 2020},

Additionally, to compensate for large errors, we have used a control resistor term. Adaptive rules parameters and terms related to the robust control part are obtained using Lyapunov stability analysis. The proposed method ensures that all signals from closed-loop are bounded and uniform. To show the capabilities and abilities of the proposed method, numerical studies on the nonlinear 6-bus system are provided.

	abstract = {From a conceptual perspective, beyond-5G technologies promise to deliver very low latency, even higher data rates, and ultrareliable connections for future generations of communication systems. Modulation schemes based on orthogonal frequency-domain multiplexing (OFDM) can accommodate these requirements for wireless systems. Several hybrid OFDM-based systems, such as the time-interleaved block-windowed burst–OFDM (TIBWB–OFDM), are capable of achieving even better spectral confinement and power efficiency. This paper addresses the implementation of the TIBWB–OFDM system in more realistic and practical wireless link scenarios by addressing the challenges of proper and reliable channel estimation and frame synchronization. We propose to incorporate a preamble formed by optimal correlation training sequences such as the Zadoff–Chu (ZC) sequences. The added ZC preamble sequence is used to jointly estimate the frame beginning through signal-correlation strategies and a threshold decision device, and acquire channel-state information (CSI) by employing estimators on the basis of the preamble sequence and transmitted data. The employed receiver estimators show that it is possible to detect the TIBWB–OFDM frame beginning and highlight the robustness of the TIBWB–OFDM technique to imperfect channel estimations by showing that it can provide comparatively close BER performance to the one where the CSI is perfectly known. © 2021 by the authors.

To facilitate over-current limiting and fault ride-through, GFM applications mandate fast current regulation and resonance damping, which should be achieved through active control using minimal hardware components and/or sensors. A comparative analysis of control performance is presented between a low voltage and a MV system, which demonstrates that lack of sufficient time-scale separation among the cascaded compensator loops in the latter may lead to substantial performance degradation or even instability.

The WATISA presents first swing TSA in terms of severity assessments. Following an event, severity assessment is quantified by assessing the number of severely affected buses connected with generators and loads. The presented method first, utilizes synchronized bus frequency and voltage measurements to construct a novel Robust Severity Assessment Index (RSAI) to capture the real-time status of a power network. Then, to determine the severity of an event, Severity Indices (SI) based on RSAI and bus voltage measurements are calculated. Finally, Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) of decision estimators is developed to evaluate associated Severity Level (SL) for incurred disturbance. To validate robustness of the proposed WATISA, its performance is tested with system topological changes and wide-area measurement noise. The simulation results on IEEE 39 bus power system highlights method effectiveness in estimating severity level with topological changes and measurement noise. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Synchrophasor estimators are nowadays evaluated with the Total Vector Error (TVE) using the synchrophasor representations of the few benchmark signals. This synchrophasor dependence prevents its application to power signals of real events. A new method to obtain the synchrophasor of real signals is proposed in this paper. A finite impulse response (FIR) filter, designed with the nonic O-spline is proposed to obtain phasor estimates asymptotically close to those of an ideal bandpass filter. The phasor estimation accuracy of one or several Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) can be then assessed using the standard. In addition, it is possible to design two FIR differentiators to obtain frequency and ROCOF estimates close enough to those of ideal differentiator filters, and largely compliant with the standard. This new set of filters opens the way to apply the synchrophasor standard to assess estimates of PMUs of different brands when they process the same signals of a power system event. In this paper, the erratic phasor and frequency estimates produced by a SEL-351 A PMU from a real distributed generation system are assessed to corroborate that the synchrophasor standard can be opened to this new application based on real signals from the field, previously considered as impossible.  © 1986-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The spread of renewable energy generation and power electronics-based devices introduces rich harmonic and interharmonic components into power system signals and significantly broadens the frequency band. These multiple components, especially the interharmonic tones, can deteriorate power quality, cause oscillations, trip thermal power generations, and threaten system stability. A first step to mitigate these negative influences is to precisely and fast monitor the signal characteristics, e.g., frequency, amplitude, and phase. This paper proposes a simple and robust index to estimate the number of signal components based on the singular values of the Hankel matrix composed of signal samples. The simplified matrix pencil theory is used to solve signal frequency and the least-squares algorithm is modified to estimate the wideband multi-component phasors. Finally, a set of numerical tests, including the maximum signal component number test, the minimum signal frequency interval test, the dynamic modulation on amplitude and phase, are carried out. Test results verify that the proposed algorithm can realize good wideband multi-component phasor estimations.  © 2022 IEEE.},

Novel approaches are needed to assess the level of energy loss and reliability in electricity distribution. Transmission of electricity in the power system is invariably accompanied by certain physical phenomena and random events causing losses. Identifying areas where excessive energy losses or excessive grid failure occur is a key element for energy companies in resource management. The study presented in the article is based on data obtained from distribution system operators concerning 41 distribution regions in Poland for a period of 5 years. The first part of the article presents an analysis of the distribution of values for the introduced energy density and energy losses in the lines of medium-and low-voltage networks and in transformers supplying the low-voltage network. The second part of the article presents the assessment of the network reliability of the same distribution regions based on analysis of the distributions of System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI) and System Average Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI) values for planned and unplanned outages.

In this context, self-tuning filter (STF) is considered to extract the fundamental component from the measured unbalanced and distorted voltages. Standard STF considers balanced grid voltages which is not always possible to ensure in the actual power grid. To mitigate this issue, an extended STF is proposed by analyzing the standard STF in the state-space framework. To make the proposed ESTF grid-following, a robust open-loop frequency estimator is also applied. The closed-loop system enjoys excellent filtering benefit from the extended STF side while taking advantage of the fast convergence speed property of the open-loop frequency estimation technique.

A novel blind SNR estimation algorithm for single carrier interleaved frequency division multiplexing (SC-IFDM) system is proposed to improve the accuracy of the estimation. The received time domain data are used to estimate the signal power and noise variance based on the order moment algorithm. The SNR of each SC-IFDM symbol as well as its average SNR over a whole sub-frame can be estimated. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing estimators at the low SNR region, and that the credible range can be extended to approximately -18dB. Besides, the algorithm is non-pilot aided, making it appealing to wireless systems for saving overhead. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Millimeter-wave is widely used for consumer radar applications like driver assistance systems in automated vehicles and gesture recognition in touch-free interfaces. To cope with the increased hardware complexity, higher costs and power consumption of wideband systems at millimeter-wave frequencies, we propose a fully digital architecture with low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) on each radio-frequency chain. The effect of the low-resolution ADCs on radar parameter estimation is characterized by the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) under the proposed hardware constraints. Prior work has shown that at low signal-to-noise ratio, a radar system with 1-bit ADCs suffers a performance loss of 2 dB in parameter estimation compared to a system with ideal infinite resolution ADCs. In this paper, we design an analog preprocessing unit that beamforms in a particular direction and improves the system performance in terms of the achievable CRB. We optimize the proposed preprocessing architecture and show that the optimized network is realizable through low-cost low-resolution phase-shifters. With the optimized preprocessor network in the system, we reduce the gap to 1.16 dB compared to a system with ideal ADCs. We demonstrate the potential of the proposed architecture to meet the requirements of high-resolution sensing through analytical derivation and numerical computation of an improved CRB and show its achievability through a correlation-based estimator.  © 2020 IEEE.},

In this paper, an estimator is proposed to estimate the equivalent inductance of the system and generate the required operating frequency to ensure operating under the resonance condition. The proposed estimator mainly depends on the measured output current magnitude and the phase shift between the inverter output voltage and current.

	abstract = {The paper considers Millimeter Wave Wireless Communication systems based on hybrid precoder-combiner structure with low-bit resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). Though the hybrid precoder-combiner structure and low-bit resolution ADCs address the problem of huge power consumption in the system, channel estimation for the system is cumbersome. In this paper, a new channel estimation scheme based on adjusted Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) algorithm is proposed. The estimator named 'AdOMP-based channel estimator' exploited the side information available at the receiver of the system to enhance the channel estimation procedure. We show through computer simulation that the proposed AdOMP-based channel estimator exhibit better performance, in the wideband wireless channel, in comparison with other three estimators i.) as the number of transmit antennas increases, ii.) as the number of radio frequency (RF) chains increases, and iii.) across the number of frames employed.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = { Radio-frequency (RF) sensing for human vital signs monitoring enables low-cost device and non-contact sensing. However, most systems occupy significant bandwidth, e.g., transmitting hundreds of WiFi packets per second, which then compete with wireless communications for spectrum. This chapter presents a narrowband RF-based respiration and pulse-rate monitoring system that utilizes orders of magnitudes less spectrum and remains low-cost and non-contact. Received power measurements are employed for this purpose, a choice that then imposes challenges due to the very low signal-to-noise ratio. A combination of antenna and frequency-diversity methods, linear and nonlinear filtering, and a new estimator are applied to address these challenges. Experimental results for pulse rate and respiration rate monitoring show errors of 1.6 bpm and 0.97 bpm, respectively, similar to the state of the art, but using three orders of magnitude less bandwidth. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {The fundamental component synchrophasors are widely used nowadays, based on the use of phasor measurement units (PMUs), in several applications in electrical power systems. For the advancement of monitoring technology, harmonic synchrophasor estimation is still a challenge. To make it possible, it is necessary to correctly estimate the harmonic phasor (magnitude and phase of each harmonic component), mainly in scenarios with frequency deviations and noise. In this context, this present article proposes the use of B-spline-based interpolation as a preprocessing algorithm for the discrete Fourier transform (DFT). The performance is evaluated in terms of total vector error (TVE) considering the tests proposed by the IEEE C37.118.1 and IEC 60255-118-1 standards and compared with four different harmonic phasor estimation (HPE) methods, the HPE, sinc interpolation function-based estimator (SIFE), Taylor-Fourier transform (TFT), and flat-top finite impulse response (FT FIR). The proposed method can provide a TVE below 1% for all harmonic phasors, from the first to the fiftieth order, under significant frequency deviation. Also, for real-time validation, the proposed method was implemented in an industrial computer as a software routine capable of processing the signals in real time. The signals are acquired by a commercial merging unit (MU) and the samples are published using the IEC 61850 sampled values (SVs) protocol. © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

To suppress the inherent resonance problem, reject input disturbance and meet the multifunction requirement in distributed generation (DG) units, a model-based estimator is proposed in this paper, which exploits the previous four consecutive output information to simultaneously calculate the value of state variable and input disturbance in real-time. Specifically, with only grid voltage and current measurement, the inverter-side current, capacitor voltage, and input voltage disturbance can be obtained, which are used to generate the optimized control law. Constant switching frequency is achieved thanks to the modulator. Therefore, the proposed control law can improve the injected power quality, and also the system hardware cost can be saved. Simulation and experiment are realized to verify the proposed method. © 2021 IEEE.},

Online algorithms for estimating modal properties from ambient data, i.e., mode meters, can benefit from accurate estimates of forced oscillations. The CRLB provides insight into how well forced oscillation parameters, e.g., frequency and amplitude, can be estimated. Previous works have solved the lower bound under a single-channel PMU measurement; thus, this paper extends works further to study CRLB under two-channel PMU measurements. The goal is to study how correlated/uncorrelated noise can affect estimation accuracy. Interestingly, these studies shows that correlated noise can decrease the CRLB in some cases. This paper derives the CRLB for the two-channel case and discusses factors that affect the bound.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The automated quantification of the behaviour of freely moving animals is increasingly needed in applied ethology. State-of-the-art approaches often require tags to identify animals, high computational power for data collection and processing, and are sensitive to environmental conditions, which limits their large-scale utilization, for instance in genetic selection programs of animal breeding. Here we introduce a new automated tracking system based on millimetre-wave radars for real time robust and high precision monitoring of untagged animals. In contrast to conventional video tracking systems, radar tracking requires low processing power, is independent on light variations and has more accurate estimations of animal positions due to a lower misdetection rate. To validate our approach, we monitored the movements of 58 sheep in a standard indoor behavioural test used for assessing social motivation. We derived new estimators from the radar data that can be used to improve the behavioural phenotyping of the sheep. We then showed how radars can be used for movement tracking at larger spatial scales, in the field, by adjusting operating frequency and radiated electromagnetic power. Millimetre-wave radars thus hold considerable promises precision farming through high-throughput recording of the behaviour of untagged animals in different types of environments. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Low-Bit Neural Network (LBNN) is a promising technique to enrich intelligent applications running on sustainable Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Although LBNN has the advantages of low memory usage, fast inference and low power consumption, Low-bit design requires additional computation units and may cause large accuracy drop. In this paper, we approach to design Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)-based LBNN accelerator to support sustainable CPS. First, we propose a method to quantize the neural networks into 2-bit weights, 8-bit activations and 8-bit biases with few accuracy loss. The mapping function is presented to approximate discrete space of weights gradually and quantize the activations and biases through the improved straight-through estimator. Second, we design the bitwise FPGA-based accelerator to speed up the LBNN. Different from traditional accelerating techniques (mainly focused on convolution layer), the dataflows of fully connected layer, pooling layer and convolution layer are considered to accelerate all layers of neural networks. The 2×8 bitwise multiplier implemented by AND/XOR operation is devised to replace 32×32-bit multiplication unit, which can bring faster inference and lower power consumption. We conduct extensive experiments on benchmarks of MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet to evaluate the efficiency of our approach. The LBNN obtained by our quantization method can save 93.75% memory with 2.26% accuracy loss on average compared with original networks. The FPGA-based accelerator achieves a peak performance of 427.71 GOPS under 100 MHz working frequency, which outperforms previous approaches significantly. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {With the increasing integration of PV generation in AC microgrids, it is challenging to keep the stability of system frequency due to the intermittent and stochastic nature of PVs. Thus, in order to reduce the investment and maintenance costs of storage systems, the electric utility has shown increasing interest in calling on PVs to provide frequency regulation services. In this paper, a novel sliding mode control (SMC) based adaptive power point tracking (APPT) control strategy is proposed to provide bi-directional primary frequency regulation (BPFR) of an AC microgrid. In this strategy, in order to restrain the variation of frequency, the sliding mode surface is adaptively regulated to provide an adaptive power reserve. Thus, the PVs will have a power headroom to regulate the frequency both up and down through releasing the reserved power or increasing the reserves of the PV systems. Furthermore, the sliding mode surface is adaptively regulated only based on the locally measured frequency of the microgrid without the requirements of communication, detailed PV model, irradiance sensors as well as MPP estimators. Thus, the proposed control strategy shows the advantages of easy to implement and reduces the investment and maintenance costs of installing storage systems or irradiance sensors.  © 1969-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the main crucial aspects of physical (PHY) layer channel coding in uplink NB-IoT systems. In uplink NB-IoT systems, various channel coding algorithms are deployed due to the nature of the adopted Long-Term Evolution (LTE) channel coding which presents a great challenge at the expense of high decoding complexity, power consumption, error floor phenomena, while experiencing performance degradation for short block lengths. For this reason, such a design considerably increases the overall system complexity, which is difficult to implement. Therefore, the existing LTE turbo codes are not recommended in NB-IoT systems and, hence, new channel coding algorithms need to be employed for LPWA specifications. First, LTE-based turbo decoding and frequency-domain turbo equalization algorithms are proposed, modifying the simplified maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) decoder and minimum mean square error (MMSE) Turbo equalization algorithms were appended to different Narrowband Physical Uplink Shared Channel (NPUSCH) subcarriers for interference cancellation. These proposed methods aim to minimize the complexity of realizing the traditional MAP turbo decoder and MMSE estimators in the newly NB-IoT PHY layer features. We compare the system performance in terms of block error rate (BLER) and computational complexity. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

It is essential to pre-process the data before being used by critical applications for situational awareness and control. In this work, two approaches for detection of data anomalies are introduced for offline (larger data processing window) and online (shorter data processing window) applications. A margin-based maximum likelihood estimator (MB-MLE) method is developed to detect anomalies by integrating the results of different base detectors including Hampel filter, Quartile detector and DBSCAN. A smoothing wavelet denoising method is used to remove high-frequency noises. The processed data with offline analysis is used to fit a model to the underlying dynamics of synchrophasor data using Koopman Mode Analysis, which is subsequently employed for online denoising and bad data detection (BDD) using Kalman Filter (KF). The parameters of the KF are adjusted adaptively based on similarity to the training data set for model fitting purposes. Developed techniques have been validated for the modified IEEE test system with multiple D-PMUs, modeled and simulated in real-time for different case scenarios using the OPAL-RT Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIL) Simulator. © 2021 IEEE.},

In this paper, a SWIPT-enhanced cell-free massive MIMO network is proposed. In such a network, a large set of spatially distributed access points (APs) interconnected via a central processing unit (CPU) can collaboratively serve a large number of both energy harvesting mobile stations (MSs) (requiring wireless energy transfer) and conventional MSs (not requiring wireless energy transfer) on the same time-frequency resources. We consider spatially correlated Rician fading channels and the use of different precoding schemes that are based on different channel estimators differing on the assumed knowledge of the line-of-sight component. Mathematically manageable expressions are derived for the harvested energy during the downlink (DL) energy harvesting phase and the achievable spectral and energy efficiencies during the uplink (UL) payload transmission phase. A coupled UL/DL optimization problem is formulated aiming at finding the power control coefficients that maximize the minimum of the weighted achievable UL signal-To-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs) of all MSs. Extensive numerical results are presented that serve to highlight the existing trade-offs among the achievable spectral and energy efficiencies, the harvested energy, the energy dedicated to UL pilot transmission or the system configuration.  © 1972-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Due to the special characteristics of the underwater environment such as pressure and temperature, many wireless communication technologies that can be implemented in a terrestrial environment cannot be implemented well in underwater environments. Therefore, it is very important to study the new generation of MWCNs. To solve the challenges mentioned in Sect. 1.2.2, this chapter proposes a novel Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) autoencoder featuring CNN-based channel estimation for marine communications with complex and fast-changing environments. We demonstrate that the proposed OFDM autoencoder system can be generalized to work under various channel environments, different throughputs, while outperform the traditional OFDM counterparts, especially when working at high throughputs. In addition, since OFDM systems require accurate channel estimations to function properly, this chapter also proposes a new channel estimation algorithm for OFDM systems that combine the power of deep learning with the philosophy of super-resolution reconstruction, which uses Dense convolutional neural Networks (Dense-Net) to reconstruct low-resolution pilot information images into high-resolution full Channel Impulse Responses (CIRs). The Dense-Net structure has the characteristics of dense connections and feature multiplexing. Simulation results show that under slow fading, the proposed channel estimator can estimate the CIRs perfectly. Under fast fading, the proposed channel estimator outperforms existing learning-based algorithms with fewer neural network parameters. Therefore, the proposed novel autoencoder scheme and the powerful channel estimator are potentially attractive approaches for MWCNs. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

The input and output passive circuits are specially designed considering AC current and the properties of the battery. A controller is proposed considering a small internal impedance, small AC ripple voltage, and variable DC offset voltage of a battery.

The controller is comprised of a feedback compensator, a feedforward term, and an estimator. The feedback gain is designed considering the internal impedance. The feedforward gain is designed based on estimated open circuit battery voltage and input voltage. The open circuit voltage estimator is designed based on filters and battery model. For validation, AC current is injected to a Valence U-12XP battery. The battery is rated for 40 Ah nominal capacity and 13.8 V nominal voltage The controller successfully injected AC current to a battery with +10 A, 0 A, and −10 A DC currents.

In order to improve the power system wideband oscillation monitoring capability, this paper proposes a wideband signal measurement algorithm based on resampling Prony estimation to achieve adaptive capture and high-precision measurement of wideband oscillation signals in the 2.5Hz-2500Hz frequency band. Firstly, on the basis of the fundamental phase volume model, a composite wideband phase volume model with several different rotational frequencies is established by using Taylor series. Secondly, the wideband signal frequency is pre-estimated by resampling Prony estimation, and the operation matrix is generated by calling the offline matrix. Finally, the least squares method is used to solve the model parameters, obtain each wideband signal phase volume in the signal, and calculate the measurement frequency by Taylor coefficients. The results show that the algorithm not only meets the measurement requirements of interharmonics and harmonics in the IEC standard, but also can accurately extract the information of each wideband signal phase quantity under frequency shift and noise conditions. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Among communication systems, multiple input multiple output (MIMO) system has the capability of providing spectral efficiency, high data rates, diversity gain, and improved reliability. Suitably designed orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) transmits the signal without inter symbol interference and multipath fading. Hence, MIMO-OFDM is a strong candidate for 4G and 5G wireless systems. However, variations in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) due to the random nature of the channel and poor capacity at low SNR are critical issues in conventional MIMO-OFDM system. This paper explains how optimal power allocation (OPA), channel estimation, and coding improve the capacity and bit error rate (BER) performance of MIMO-OFDM system. In OPA, the transmitter power is distributed adaptively to the channels based on the SNR statistics using singular value decomposition and water filling algorithm. In case of low SNR, less number of channels are selected for power allocation. Least squares (LS), minimum mean square error (MMSE), and least mean square (LMS) estimators are considered in comb type pilot channel estimation while turbo code is used with code rates of 1/2 and 1/3. From the simulation results, capacity improvement of 5 b/s/Hz and 11 b/s/Hz is observed for MIMO-OFDM systems with four antennas and eight antennas, respectively. It is also found that performance of LMS estimator improved by 3.5-dB SNR over LS and 1 dB SNR over MMSE. In this paper is shown how LMS estimator and 1/3 turbo code have been integrated with MIMO-OFDM, and this has resulted in around 4-dB SNR improvement over conventional MIMO-OFDM. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

It is essential to preprocess the data before being used by critical applications for situational awareness and control. In this work, two approaches for detection of data anomalies are introduced for offline (larger data processing window) and online (shorter data processing window) applications. A smoothing wavelet denoising method is used to remove high-frequency noises. An ensemble approach built upon the margin-based maximum likelihood estimator (MB-MLE) method is developed to detect anomalies in denoised data by integration of the results from different base detectors including Hampel filter, Quartile detector, and DBSCAN. The processed data with offline analysis is used to fit a model to the underlying dynamics of synchrophasor data using Koopman mode analysis, which is subsequently employed for online denoising and bad data detection using Kalman filter (KF). The parameters of the KF are adjusted adaptively based on similarity to the training dataset for model fitting purposes. Developed techniques have been validated for the modified IEEE test system with multiple D-PMUs, modeled and simulated in real-time for different case scenarios using the OPAL-RT hardware-in-the-loop simulator.  © 1972-2012 IEEE.},

Estimates of rack force can be used by EPS to reduce driver effort and enhance driving performance. Further, estimates of the components of rack force can be used to perform targeted compensation to enhance steering feel and vehicle safety. Existing rack force estimators either do not support the estimation of rack force components or are only applicable for driving on flat roads. This paper presents three vehicle and tire model-based rack force estimators that can estimate individual components of rack force as well as the total rack force for driving on uneven roads. The estimators use the same vehicle model but use tire models of differing complexities. The performance of the estimators was validated and compared by performing driving experiments with non-aggressive and aggressive steering maneuvers on roads with low and high frequency profile variations. The results show that the estimation accuracy increases with the complexity of tire model used, especially during aggressive steering maneuvers and high frequency road profile variations. Finally, results from a simulation study are presented to show that the estimators are also capable of estimating the components of rack force. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Radar sensors are crucial for environment perception of driver assistance systems as well as autonomous vehicles. With a rising number of radar sensors and the so far unregulated automotive radar frequency band, mutual interference is inevitable and must be dealt with. Algorithms and models operating on radar data are required to run the early processing steps on specialized radar sensor hardware. This specialized hardware typically has strict resource-constraints, i.e. a low memory capacity and low computational power. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based approaches for denoising and interference mitigation yield promising results for radar processing in terms of performance. Regarding resource-constraints, however, CNNs typically exceed the hardware's capacities by far. In this paper we investigate quantization techniques for CNN-based denoising and interference mitigation of radar signals. We analyze the quantization of (i) weights and (ii) activations of different CNN-based model architectures. This quantization results in reduced memory requirements for model storage and during inference. We compare models with fixed and learned bit-widths and contrast two different methodologies for training quantized CNNs, i.e. the straight-through gradient estimator and training distributions over discrete weights. We illustrate the importance of structurally small real-valued base models for quantization and show that learned bit-widths yield the smallest models. We achieve a memory reduction of around 80% compared to the real-valued baseline. Due to practical reasons, however, we recommend the use of 8 bits for weights and activations, which results in models that require only 0.2 megabytes of memory.  © 2007-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The nonlinear distortions attributed by the radio frequency (RF) power amplifier (PA) and other RF circuits from the enormous bandwidth of millimeter wave (mmWave) and high frequency design limitations of the integrated circuits involved, degrade the performance of the hybrid mmWave multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. This nonlinear distortions in the hybrid mmWave systems cause nonlinear coupling of the hybrid precoder with the data signals. Further, it induces intercarrier interference (ICI) in the OFDM systems, which also involves the interference from the precoders of other subcarriers. These difficulties in collusion with frequency selective channel and carrier frequency offset (CFO) may pose great challenges to the estimation accuracy of these parameters (channel gains and CFO) and signal detection. The nonlinearity causes the target posterior distribution for data detection as non-Gaussian and analytically intractable. In this work, we present a novel pilot assisted maximum likelihood (ML) based framework for estimating the CFO with PA impairment in the time domain by formulating a low dimensional equivalent channel matrix. The low dimensional equivalent channel matrix is composed of hybrid precoders-combiners, high dimensional MIMO channel, and the nonlinearly distorted components from PA. We further propose a group-sparse Bayesian learning (G-SBL) based semi-blind channel estimator in the time domain, which incorporates the CFO and nonlinearity of PA in its estimation process. With the estimated channel, a procedure to obtain the hybrid precoder and combiner matrices for data transmission is developed next. An iterative algorithm based on particle filter (PF) that effectively handles the nonlinear coupling of precoder matrix with data, and ICI is also proposed for data detection. The performance of the algorithms are evaluated on two different channel models: (a) synthetic geometric based mmWave channel (b) realistic mmWave channel for an urban microcell (UMi) environment. To validate the efficacy of the CFO and channel estimator, the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) and Bayesian CRB (BCRB) are derived respectively. © 1967-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Ambient Vibration-Based Structural Health Monitoring (AVB–SHM) studies on prone-to-fall rock compartments have recently succeeded in detecting both pre-failure damaging processes and reinforcement provided by bolting. The current AVB–SHM instrumentation layout is yet generally an overkill, creating cost and power issues and sometimes requiring advanced signal processing techniques. In this article, we paved the way toward an innovative edge-computing approach tested on ambient vibration records made during the bolting of a ~760 m3 limestone rock column (Vercors, France). First, we established some guidelines for prone-to-fall rock column AVB–SHM by comparing several basic, computing-efficient, seismic parameters (i.e., Fast Fourier Transform, Horizontal to Vertical and Horizontal to Horizontal Spectral Ratios). All three parameters performed well in revealing the unstable compartment’s fundamental resonance frequency. HHSR appeared as the most consistent spectral estimator, succeeding in revealing both the fundamental and higher modes. Only the fundamental mode should be trustfully monitored with HVSR since higher peaks may be artifacts. Then, the first application of a novelty detection algorithm on an unstable rock column AVB–SHM case study showed the following: the feasibility of automatic removing the adverse thermomechanical fluctuations in column’s dynamic parameters based on machine learning, as well as the systematic detection of clear, permanent change in column’s dynamic behavior after grout injection and hardening around the bolts (i1 and i2 ). This implementation represents a significant workload reduction, compared to physical-based algorithms or numerical twin modeling, and shows better robustness with regard to instrumentation gaps. We believe that edge-computing monitoring systems combining basic seismic signal processing techniques and automatic detection algorithms could help facilitate AVB–SHM of remote natural structures such as prone-to-fall rock compartments. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {A cost-effective and robust digital signal processing (DSP) scheme is proposed and demonstrated experimentally in a coherent 61 GBaud PDM 16QAM system. In our scheme, multi-stage DSP blocks are used to deal with channel effects, transceiver in-phase and quadrature (IQ) skew, and phase noise. A 4x4 real-valued multiple-input multiple-output (RV-MIMO) with N1 taps is for polarization recovery and receiver IQ skew calibration. After frequency offset compensation, two 2x2 RV-MIMO with N2 taps are used to compensate for chromatic dispersion (CD), inter-symbol interference, transmitter IQ skew, and phase noise. Finally, the residual phase noise is eliminated by the maximum likelihood (ML) estimator. The experimental results indicate that the proposed scheme provides better received optical power sensitivity and CD tolerance than the existing simplified DSP schemes. In addition, the proposed scheme can tolerate transmitter IQ skew up to 7 ps in a 10 km case, which outperforms both simplified and conventional DSP schemes. Meanwhile, the proposed scheme can keep the same transceiver IQ skew andCDtolerance and has reduced complexity by 25% after 10 km links, compared to 4x4 RV-MIMO followed by a transmitter skew compensator. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed scheme is the most cost-effective solution for a high baud rate datacenter interconnects where transmitter IQ skew and CD have to be dealt with. ©2021 Optical Society of America.},

With the development of biology and medical engineering, there is a high demand for real-time and robust SIM imaging under extreme low-light and short-exposure environments. Existing SIM techniques typically require multiple structured illumination frames to produce a high-resolution image. In this article, we propose a single-frame SIM (SF-SIM) based on deep learning. Our SF-SIM only needs one shot of a structured illumination frame and generates similar results compared with the traditional SIM systems that typically require 15 shots. In our SF-SIM, we propose a noise estimator that can effectively suppress the noise in the image and enable our method to work in the low-light and short-exposure environment without the need for stacking multiple frames for nonlocal denoising. We also design a bandpass attention module that makes our deep network more sensitive to the change of frequency and enhances the imaging quality. Our proposed SF-SIM is almost 14 times faster than traditional SIM methods when achieving similar results. Therefore, our method is significantly valuable for the development of microbiology and medicine. © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Protection-oriented (P Class) phasor measurement units (PMUs) are required to reconcile high measurement accuracy and low latency in order to promptly detect possible anomalous operating conditions in power systems. Most of the existing estimators of synchrophasor magnitude, phase, frequency, and rate of change of frequency (ROCOF) of voltage or current AC waveforms need to acquire the samples of at least two power line cycles to meet the P Class requirements specified in the IEEE/IEC Standard 60255-118-1:2018. In this article, instead, a multistep technique based on the combination of multiple signal classification (MUSIC), narrowband disturbance whitening, and Taylor-Kalman Filtering (TKF) is proposed to maximize accuracy even over one-cycle-long observation intervals. Both MUSIC and disturbance whitening rely on a common theoretical framework (i.e., signal and noise vector subspace decomposition) and they are applied to compensate for the detrimental effect of off-nominal frequency deviations and harmonic distortion, respectively. The use of cascaded dynamic estimators such as the TKF is motivated by the need to track possible in-band amplitude and phase oscillations or step-like changes with low latency. While the basic TKF is very sensitive to possible narrowband disturbances, the tuned whitening-based TKF (TW-TKF) described in this article ensures superior accuracy under the influence of harmonics and amplitude or phase step changes, with just a minor performance degradation in the other P Class testing conditions reported in the IEEE/IEC Standard 60255-118-1:2018.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Spectral analysis constitutes an essential technique for random vibration fatigue. The power spectral density (PSD) provides an efficient, statistically unique characterization of stationary Gaussian loading which can be effectively processed via linear systems theory and load-spectrum estimators such as the Dirlik formulation. The PSD represents vibration loading by its averaged intensity for frequency. However, if the intensity varies throughout a dataset, i.e. the loading is non-stationary, the PSD has a fundamental flaw – it conceals any information about its evolution. Consequently, the PSD is not qualified to describe non-stationary loading and thus cannot represent instantaneous highly damaging events in a fatigue assessment. Therefore, this article proposes a statistical characterization particularly formulated for the specifications of non-stationary random vibration fatigue. We introduce a non-stationarity matrix defined as the auto-correlation matrix of short-time Fourier transforms, which describes the average variation and interaction of intensity by frequency. This characterization can directly be related to fourth-order statistics (kurtosis, trispectrum, etc.) and allows to be processed via linear systems theory. Thereby the influence of a loading's non-stationarity structure on structural responses, and thus fatigue damage, can be assessed. Furthermore, this article provides the basis for an accompanying article in which the non-stationarity matrix finds application to efficiently perform fatigue analyses for non-stationary loading via a statistical approach using load-spectrum estimators. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Background: In spite of the large number of anti-corruption reforms implemented in different countries, there has been little research that empirically and systematically assesses the impact of these efforts. Objectives: The main objective of this review is to identify what works in curbing corruption in the public sector, by meta-analyzing the findings of published and unpublished evaluations of different types of anti-corruption interventions in different countries. The focus of this review is administrative corruption, namely corrupt acts involving civil servants in their dealings with their superiors, during the implementation of public policies, or while interacting with the public for service delivery. Political corruption (in the adoption of laws, regulations, and policies), and private-to-private corruption (involving only private actors) are excluded from this review. Search methods: The literature search was conducted by querying three widely recognized electronic databases: RePEc, SSRN, and Web of Science. These databases are considered the most comprehensive in the socio-economic field of research. The main grey literature repositories were also queried. Both published and unpublished studies were searched on the basis of specific combinations of keywords. The terms used to define queries were based on the “types of corruption”, “types of interventions/policies/reforms” and “study design” search strings. Specific conventions were used to “explode” or “truncate” keywords as appropriate. Screening of the references (i.e., snowballing) of the identified studies was also performed, and a reverse snowballing approach on Google Scholar was used. In order to ensure replicability, all searches were stored into Covidence, an online software developed by the Cochrane community for screening studies and extracting data for systematic reviews. Selection criteria: Any study that included experimental evaluations (randomized controlled trials) of interventions developed for use in the public sector (e.g., public administration, education, health, etc.) to curb administrative corruption has been included in this review without any geographical or temporal limitations. Only studies written in or translated into English have been considered. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors read the titles and abstracts of identified studies in order to determine their eligibility against the inclusion/exclusion criteria. When a title or abstract could not be included or rejected with certainty, the full text of the article was reviewed. In case of disagreement about whether or not a study should be included, the lead author (Giulia Mugellini), together with Martin Killias acted as arbitrator. The relevant information from identified studies was extracted independently by two review authors, following the guidelines of the Campbell Collaboration. The studies were assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias checklist as a basis. The effect size selected for the analysis was the Fisher's z-score transformation of the partial correlation coefficient. For the meta-analysis, random effect(s) models were estimated. Meta-regression analysis models were then used to investigate the determinants behind the observed between- and within-study heterogeneity. Ten different covariates were included in the meta-regression models in order to control for the type of intervention, the type of corruption, the level of national income, the quality of the study and the type of participants involved in laboratory experiments. Results: The initial literature search led to the identification of 70 studies. Approximately one-third of the studies were excluded at the title/abstract stage because they either did not evaluate any anti-corruption intervention but simply assessed the relationship between corruption and other phenomena, or because the study design was not based on randomized controlled trials. Another 14 studies were excluded only after a full-text assessment. At this stage, the main reasons for exclusion were related to an unsuitable type of corruption (e.g., when the focus of the paper was political corruption, or private-to-private corruption instead of administrative corruption), the lack of regression output, or an unsuitable study design. At the end of the selection process, 29 studies resulted as eligible for inclusion. All the selected studies were written in English. The publication years ranged from 2007 to 2018. The majority of the selected studies (20) investigates the effect of anti-corruption interventions in high- and upper-middle income countries (Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Germany, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and the United States). Nine studies focused on low- and low-middle income countries (Burkina Faso, Burundi, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Tanzania, and Uganda). All of them were randomized experiments. Twenty-five of these experiments were conducted in a laboratory, while four of them were field experiments. As to the type of outcome, the majority (18) of the selected studies addressed bribery (either active or passive), while 11 studies considered misappropriation of public resources (embezzlement). In terms of anti-corruption interventions, 19 studies tested the effect of deterrence interventions, while 10 studies focused on policies based on organizational and cultural change. Overall, the meta-analysis’ findings indicate that the identified interventions decrease the level of corruption. Results are statistically significant (p < 0.01) and robust to different heterogeneity estimators—that is, (restricted) maximum likelihood and method of moment estimators. The observed high level of heterogeneity— (Formula presented.) is equal to 92.36%, of which 43.78% is due to between-study heterogeneity and 48.57% to within-study heterogeneity—albeit in line with other meta-analyses in economics, suggests the need for meta-regression analyses. To investigate the determinants behind the between- and within-study heterogeneity of the observed effect, both a random effect model and a multilevel model were adopted. The results of the multilevel model show that:. 1) Control and deterrence interventions are more effective than organizational and cultural reforms in reducing corruption in the public sector. 2) Combining different interventions reduces corruption more than single interventions. 3) Interventions are more effective in preventing misappropriation of public resources (embezzlement) than passive or active bribery. Finally, the Funnel Asymmetry Test (FAT), conducted with both additive and multiplicative dispersion terms, shows no evidence of a strong publication bias in the literature. Authors’ conclusions: The results of this systematic review, based on a combination of laboratory and field experiments, demonstrate that increasing the expected monetary costs (e.g., sanctions) of corruption or the probability of detection (e.g., audit risk) is more effective than organizational, cultural and educational interventions in curbing administrative corruption, at least in the short term. However, this result might be due to the fact that the majority of selected studies are based on lab-experiments, where the assessment of the intervention is almost concurrent to its development. Short-term evaluations might fail to identify the effect of organizational and cultural interventions. Indeed, these interventions are based on structural changes in the organization of the system and the ethical and cultural education of public officials and might, thus, entail long periods to display their results on the level of corruption. Nevertheless, a combination of different interventions proves to be more effective than single interventions. For example, policies guaranteeing impunity to officials or citizens who report corrupt practices (principal witness/leniency treatment) are more effective if associated with a high probability of audit than leniency alone. A low probability of detection can be compensated by the threat of high fines in reducing both the amount and the likelihood of bribe demands. To the contrary, a high probability of detection had no effect in the absence of severe sanction threats. The importance of the organizational and cultural environment in which the intervention is implemented clearly emerged in the literature. When possible, the characteristics of the settings where the interventions were developed were included in the meta-regression analysis (such as the level of income of the countries). When it was not possible to measure contextual factors and their interaction with the main intervention, a qualitative analysis was performed to reveal the complexities of these interactions. This additional analysis shows that the impact of the interventions was found to be affected by the likelihood of the continued interactions between bribe takers and givers, the amount and probability of fines, and the size of the bribe, among others. For example, reporting mechanisms and leniency policies increase their potential in combination with interventions that limit agent's exposure to one another – such as staff rotation. The success of audit risk on corruption is strongly dependent on the seriousness of the potential sanction and the probability that a sanction is applied. Some differences also emerge between high- and low-corruption countries regarding the effectiveness of anti-corruption interventions. For example, measures tending to increase social blame of corrupt practices work in low-corruption countries. Adding punishments in environments where actors’ behavior is tightly monitored increases compliance, but more so in environments where corruption is the exception rather than the rule. In terms of implications for research, the fact that control and deterrence turns out to be more effective than organizational and cultural interventions in curbing administrative corruption confirms the importance of economic theories (and cost-benefit analysis). However, the meta-analysis also demonstrates the effectiveness of combining different types of interventions. This is true not only when combining policies reinforcing control and deterrence (monitoring frequency, detection probability and amount of fines), but also when policies based on organizational and cultural change are added (e.g., staff rotation and leniency). In particular, the role of moral levers in preventing corruption emerges, and especially the importance of strengthening professional identity and values in order to avoid conflicts between an individual's private interests and his/her public role. These results highlight the importance of going beyond economic models for explaining corruption, and considering the moral and cultural mechanisms underlying this phenomenon. It also emerges the need to understand how different forms of corruption operate in practice at macro- (cross-country), meso- (country/nation-state) and micro- (individual) level. In particular, individual-level factors, such as the strive for power, low self-control, loss aversion and risk acceptance would need to be addressed. It would be interesting to distinguish, when more experimental studies will be available, between top-down (from supervisors to officials) and bottom-up (from citizens to officials) interventions. From a methodological point of view, it could be tested whether the results change according to the types of games used as a basis for the corruption experiments (e.g., behavioral game theory, trust game, etc.) and according to the setting in which the experiment was conducted (e.g., context-free versus in-context presentation of experimental tasks). Considering the effect of sensitization messages in reducing bribery demand, we would encourage researchers to develop other corruption experiments that explore the impact of interventions in fostering professional self-identity, as well as the impact of organizational family culture on corruption. Furthermore, this review highlights the need for a comprehensive classification of anti-corruption policies that distinguishes interventions by type of corruption, risk factors, type of policy tool and administrative sector. © 2021 The Authors.

	abstract = {This paper presents a modified Gradient-based method to directly compute the noise subspace iteratively from the received Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) symbols to estimate Channel State Information (CSI). By invoking the matrix inversion lemma which is extensively used in Recursive Least Square (RLS) algorithms, the proposed computationally efficient method enables direct computation of noise subspace using the inverse of the autocorrelation matrix of the received OFDM symbols. In the case of a vector input, the modified Gradient algorithm uses rank one update to calculate noise subspace recursively. For an input in the matrix form, the modified Gradient algorithm uses a full rank update. The validity, efficacy, and accuracy of the proposed modified Gradient algorithm have been substantiated through a relative comparison of the results with the conventional Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) algorithm, which is in wide use in the estimation of the subspaces. The simulation results obtained through the modified Gradient algorithm show a satisfactory correlation with the results of SVD, even though the computational complexity involved in modified Gradient is relatively less. Apart from the results encompassing various power levels of the multipath channel, this paper also discusses the adaptive tracking of CSI and presents a comparative study. © 2022.

	abstract = {Massive MIMO is one of the main features of 5G mobile radio systems. However, it often leads to high cost, size and power consumption. To overcome these issues, the use of constrained radio frequency (RF) frontends has been proposed, as well as novel precoders, e.g., a multi-antenna, greedy, iterative and quantized precoding algorithm (MAGIQ). Nevertheless, the best performance of MAGIQ assumes accurate channel knowledge per antenna element, for example, from uplink sounding reference signals. In this context, we propose an efficient uplink channel estimator by applying machine learning (ML) algorithms. In a first step a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) predicts the radio channels from a limited set of full resolution RF chains to the rest of the low resolution RF chain antenna elements. A long-short term memory (LSTM) neural network extracts further phase information from the low resolution RF chain antenna elements. Our results indicate that our proposed ML approach is competitive with traditional Unitary Tensor-ESPRIT in scenarios with various closely spaced multipath components (MPCs). © 2021 IEEE.},

However, low-frequency oscillations, especially inter-area oscillations (IAOs) can be adversely affected due to their intermittent nature. This article proposes a wide-area damping controller (WADC) for WTS-integrated power system to damp IAOs effectively. The feedback signals (linear combination of the system states) are directly measurable from phasor measurement units. Therefore a reduced-order estimator is proposed instead of a full-order estimator to design the WADC. Furthermore, to select appropriate feedback signals for WADC design, combined geometric measure and modal decomposition techniques are utilized. The overall procedure to design the reduced-order WADC includes feedback signal selection, state feedback formulation using modal transformation approach, and reduced-order estimator design using loop transfer recovery procedure. Moreover, the WADC parameters are selected considering operating point uncertainties and variable time delays in feedback signals. Performance of the proposed WADC is validated on WTS-integrated 16-machine, 68-bus system. The simulation results show that the proposed WADC gives robust performance over broad operating scenarios.  © 1972-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Information complexity in animals is an indicator of advanced communication and an intricate socio-ecology. Zipf's Law of least effort has been used to assess the potential information content of animal repertoires, including whether or not a particular animal communication could be ‘language-like’. As all human languages follow Zipf's law, with a power law coefficient (PLC) close to −1, animal signals with similar probability distributions are postulated to possess similar information characteristics to language. However, estimation of the PLC from limited empirical datasets (e.g. most animal communication studies) is problematic because of biases from small sample sizes. The traditional approach to estimating Zipf's law PLC is to find the slope of a log–log rank-frequency plot. Our alternative option uses the underlying equivalence between Shannon entropy (i.e. whether successive elements of a sequence are unpredictable, or repetitive) and PLC. Here, we test whether an entropy approach yields more robust estimates of Zipf's law PLC than the traditional approach. We examined the efficacy of the entropy approach in two ways. First, we estimated the PLC from synthetic datasets generated with a priori known power law probability distributions. This revealed that the estimated PLC using the traditional method is particularly inaccurate for highly stereotyped sequences, even at modest repertoire sizes. Estimation via Shannon entropy is accurate with modest sample sizes even for repertoires with thousands of distinct elements. Second, we applied these approaches to empirical data taken from 11 animal species. Shannon entropy produced a more robust estimate of PLC with lower variance than the traditional method, even when the true PLC is unknown. Our approach for the first time reveals Zipf's law operating in the vocal systems of multiple lineages: songbirds, hyraxes and cetaceans. As different methods of estimating the PLC can lead to misleading results in real data, estimating the balance of a communication system between simplicity and complexity is best performed using the entropy approach. This provides a more robust way to investigate the evolutionary constraints and processes that have acted on animal communication systems, and the parallels between these processes and the evolution of language. © 2020 British Ecological Society},

	abstract = {To reduce the adverse influence of communication time delay, the DC voltage of offshore converters is usually employed as input signals of existing communication-free frequency support schemes of offshore wind farms (OWFs). However, the offshore DC voltage varies with the output power of OWFs, this distortion will deteriorate the frequency support performance. To address this issue, an improved communication-free coordinated control (ICFCC) scheme of VSC-MTDC integrated OWFs for frequency support is proposed. The ICFCC scheme involves the onshore frequency variation into the DC voltage deviation once frequency events occur, and an estimator is proposed to obtain the onshore DC voltage in offshore VSC stations to provide fast frequency support and reduce the distortion influence. Meanwhile, to obtain better support performance, the frequency support power is allocated reasonably by regulating droop coefficients adaptively, more power will be injected via the station closer to the disturbing bus. After frequency support, the offshore wind turbines will recover their rotor speed with asymptotic control to reduce second frequency drop. Case studies are carried out on the 4-terminal and 5-terminal test systems, respectively, while considering the parameter uncertainties and noise disturbance. Different control methods are compared to illustrate the effectiveness of the ICFCC scheme. IEEE},

The known extended self-tuning filter (STF) adheres to an increased structural complexity, which may consume memory in the digital hardware to estimate the fundamental grid voltage signal. The proposed STF, which relies on a simple non-adaptive comb filter, may address this issue. Consequently, the introduction of imaginary zeros ensures better rejection of the DC-offset and the harmonic components while keeping the proposed filter structure simpler to implement. Furthermore, a simple open-loop frequency estimator is proposed, which does not involve any inverse trigonometric function to estimate the fundamental frequency. This entire proposal is cost-effective and has good frequency tracking abilities with a reduced computational load.

	abstract = {The development of intelligent radios in wireless applications is mainly driven by the growing need for higher data rates, along with constrained spectrum resources. An intelligent radio is one that can autonomously assess the communication environment and automatically update the communication parameters to achieve optimal performance. The problem of determining the type of space-frequency block coding (SFBC) for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) transmissions is one of the main tasks of an intelligent receiver. Previous approaches to this problem are restricted to uncoded communications; nevertheless, existing systems typically utilize error-correcting codes. This study develops a maximum-likelihood (ML) classifier that discriminates among SFBC-OFDM signals using the soft outputs of a channel decoder. The mathematical analysis shows that the maximization of the likelihood function can be carried out by employing an iterative expectation-maximization (EM) procedure. A channel estimator is also included in the proposed classifier as a vital step. The findings show that the classification performance of the proposed algorithm is considerably better than the classical classifiers reported in the literature, at the cost of an acceptable increase in computing complexity.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This work presents a model-based frequency-locked loop (FLL) for three-phase systems subject to unbalance and harmonic distortion conditions. It is based on a pretty general model of a three-phase AC reference signal comprising a set of harmonic oscillators. Likewise, the proposed synchronization scheme comprises a set of adaptive harmonic oscillators to estimate the corresponding harmonic components. The proposed scheme considers three different types of harmonic oscillators that distinguish among the sequences involved on each harmonic component, which leads to a less demanding computational effort. The harmonic oscillators of higher order are grouped in a harmonic compensation mechanism dedicated to coping with the harmonic content of the reference signal. Therefore, the main contributions of this work are (i) the incorporation of a complex gain to accelerate the dynamic response of the scheme, (ii) the derivation of sequence-specific oscillators, and (iii) the stability analysis based on Lyapunov's approach, which shows that the proposed scheme is globally stable provided the bandwidth of the frequency estimator is bounded. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Tracking and monitoring systems have gained increasing attention with the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper provides a brief overview of the IoT and cognitive capabilities of the Internet of Medical Things (CIoMT) and the Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT) for COVID-19. This paper focuses on the data acquisition phase of these applications, as it has the most constrained resources and sensors and is subjected to the challenge of heating as some sensors are directly attached to patients bodies. SIMON lightweight block cipher is used in this paper based on research conducted about the most published papers in Scopus discussing the use of lightweight cryptography to secure IoT and Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN). SIMON has more papers than AES RC5, RC6, PRESENT, and CLEFIA combined. In these papers, SIMON subjected and proved reliance on various cryptanalysis, including linear, differential, impossible differential, zero-correlation linear, and rational-XOR. WBAN and IoT applications WBAN are subjected to various security and privacy attacks, combined with limited space and power resources. Therefore, we propose to use SIMON with various configurations written in VHDL, depending on the implementation context, to maintain the privacy of patients sensitive data and sustain the required confidentiality requirement of such applications. Thus, Xilinx Vivado 2021.1 was used for verifying, synthesizing, and simulating the various configurations, i.e., SIMON scalar 128/128, 64/128 and 32/64 designs, along with 64/128 outer round pipelined and 64/128 mixed round pipelined. Therefore, xc7z010clg400-1 SoC (Zybo) FPGA is used as the board, with a Zynq-7000 device as a reference to synthesize the designs, and the performance indicators in this paper are LUTs, frequency, IOBs, and throughput-to-slice (TP/slice). Moreover, the Cadence Genus tool is used to calculate estimated battery life, area, and gate count for the scalar designs based on the modified frequencies suitable for these applications, including RTL implementations and Joules power estimator using a Samsung 28nm process. Hence, at the data acquisition level, Simon 32/64 is selected as a preferred core for implementation. It is reasonably robust from a security perspective, while still looks like a reasonable compromise and a lot smaller than the 64/128 and 128/128 and has less wasted resources on all fronts.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The Interpolated Discrete Fourier Transform (IpDFT) is one of the most popular algorithms for Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs), due to its quite low computational complexity and its good accuracy in various operating conditions. However, the basic IpDFT algorithm can be used also as a preliminary estimator of the amplitude, phase, frequency and rate of change of frequency of voltage or current AC waveforms at times synchronized to the Universal Coordinated Time (UTC). Indeed, another cascaded algorithm can be used to refine the waveform parameters estimation. In this context, the main novelty of this work is a fair and extensive performance comparison of three different state-of-the-art IpDFT-tuned estimation algorithms for PMUs. The three algorithms are: (i) the so-called corrected IpDFT (IpDFTc), which is conceived to compensate for the effect of both the image of the fundamental tone and second-order harmonic; (ii) a frequency-tuned version of the Taylor Weighted Least-Squares (TWLS) algorithm, and (iii) the frequency Down-Conversion and low-pass Filtering (DCF) technique described also in the IEEE/IEC Standard 60255-118-1:2018. The simulation results obtained in the P Class and M Class testing conditions specified in the same Standard show that the IpDFTc algorithm is generally preferable under the effect of steady-state disturbances. On the contrary, the tuned TWLS estimator is usually the best solution when dynamic changes of amplitude, phase or frequency occur. In transient conditions (i.e., under the effect of amplitude or phase steps), the IpDFTc and the tuned TWLS algorithms do not clearly outperform one another. The DCF approach generally returns the worst results. However, its actual performances heavily depend on the adopted low-pass filter. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

The slime mould algorithm is applied to obtain near-optimum gains of the hy-FOC via the minimization of an integral error criterion. Moreover, a Luenberger disturbance observer (Dob) is designed to estimate uncertain plant disturbances and incorporate estimated output into the control law to alleviate chattering in the output of sliding mode controller (SMC). The acceptability and superiority of the proposed hy-FOC are established by performing an extensive comparative study with the results of PI-derivative (PID), SMC, FOPID, and FOSMC under diverse operating conditions (model uncertainties and uncertain external disturbances). The simulation results are presented and discussed to authenticate proficiency of the proposed resilient control methodology over its other integral-order and fractional-order counterparts. Governor dead-band and generation rate constraint (thermal unit) as a provenance of physical limitations are also considered in the model to show the proposed controller's effectiveness for handling the practical challenges.

They are defined as the decomposition of central moments and cumulants over frequency and form a powerful tool to assess nonlinear, non-Gaussian or non-stationary systems and processes. The estimation theory of higher-order spectra has emerged from the research on power spectral density estimation. The estimator proposed here complements the existing estimators with a generalized theory of frequency-domain smoothing. It represents the domain-reversed counterpart of the popular method of averaging raw spectra from short-time Fourier transforms. The main selling points are the consistent approach to smoothing with a better bias-variance trade-off, its computational efficiency by averaging in the time domain and its flexibility and simplicity. These properties, the mathematical derivation and the analogy to averaging of raw spectra are presented. Numerical studies outline basic properties of the estimator. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

In order to improve estimation accuracy with no need to prolong the data record size and the related delays, this paper presents a Taylor Kalman Filter (TKF) enhanced with a preliminary stage able to whiten possible narrowband disturbances over short observation intervals. The use of dynamic estimators such as the TKF is motivated by the need to track possible sudden amplitude or phase changes of voltage or current AC waveforms, which are likely to occur in smart grids. However, while a basic TKF is very sensitive to disturbances different from white noise, the proposed whitening-Technique is able to greatly improve the estimation accuracy of synchrophasor amplitude, phase, frequency and Rate of Change of Frequency (ROCOF) under the influence of harmonics and amplitude or phase step changes even over one-cycle observation intervals, with just a minor performance degradation in the other P Class testing conditions reported in the IEEE/IEC Standard 60255-118-1:2018.  © 2021 IEEE.},

To eliminate the influence of random noise on the accuracy of identification, the adaptive technology is introduced into EKF to estimate the process and measurement noise covariance in real time through the Sage-Husa estimator.

While the PSD assembles a full stochastic characterization of stationary Gaussian loading, for loading subjected to changing operational, environmental, and excitational conditions, it provides no means of a fluctuating spectral density. Therefore, the PSD neither qualifies to characterize varying loads, nor reproduces comparable stress amplitudes to a referencing non-stationary excitation following a statistical-based stress analysis. Consequently, this paper employs the non-stationarity matrix to characterize the varying evolution of realistic loading and proposes a system of equations that decomposes this characterization into stationary Gaussian portions. The fundamental idea is to approximate realistic loading by abstracting a series of stationary segments, whose assembly in return embodies a full statistical characterization. The resulting quasi-stationary load definition better reflects the fatigue damage potential of realistic, non-stationary loading and allows to implement load spectrum estimators, ensuing computationally efficient and statistically robust structural lifetime predictions. Further, quasi-stationary load definitions are utilized to advance the concept of damage-equivalent statistical load definitions to be independent of a specific Miner exponent. © 2021},

	abstract = {Virtual synchronous generators (VSGs) with inertia characteristics are generally adopted for the control of distributed generators (DGs) in order to mimic a synchronous generator. However, since the amount of virtual inertia in VSG control is usually constant and given by trial and error, the real power and frequency oscillations of a battery energy storage system (BESS) occurring under load variation result in the degradation of the control performance of the DG. Thus, in this study, a novel virtual inertia estimation methodology is proposed to estimate suitable values of virtual inertia for VSGs and to suppress the real power output and frequency oscillations of the DG under load variation. In addition, to improve the function of the proposed virtual inertia estimator and the transient responses of the real power output and frequency of the DG, an online-trained Petri probabilistic wavelet fuzzy neural network (PPWFNN) controller is proposed to replace the proportional integral (PI) controller. The network structure and the online learning algorithm using backpropagation (BP) of the proposed PPWFNN are represented in detail. Finally, on the basis of the experimental results, it can be concluded that superior performance in terms of real power output and frequency response under load variation can be achieved by using the proposed virtual inertia estimator and the intelligent PPWFNN controller. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Many reasons, such as power system load changes, sub-synchronous resonance and so on, will cause the system frequency to deviate from the nominal frequency of the system. The maximum frequency deviation specified in IEEE standard C37.118.1 and the latest revised C37.118.1a can reach 5Hz and larger frequency deviation will cause Taylor-Fourier to produce serious analysis errors. This paper proposed a dynamic synchronous phasor estimator considering frequency deviation. In this estimator, multiple discrete frequencies were generated at fixed frequency intervals on both sides of the nominal frequency, and then the corresponding dynamic filters were generated offline based on these frequencies, and the filter coefficients were saved to the memory for use during online operation. When the algorithm was running, Taylor-Fourier was used as a frequency detector to predict the signal frequency, and the closest discrete frequency was selected according to the predicted frequency. Then, the corresponding filter was found through the lookup table method to analyze the input signal and accurate measurement of synchronous phasor was realized under the frequency deviation case. Finally, the proposed estimator was tested through simulation and actual signal data. Test results show that the estimator can estimate the synchrophasor, frequency and rate of change of frequency under frequency deviation conditions. © 2021, Electrical Technology Press Co. Ltd.

This work aims to determine the power and delay spread from the light source to the receiver plane. The positions of the light source and receiver were used for power estimation. We focus on analog orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) in visible light communication (VLC) and assess the area under the curve (AUC). The proposed system was designed using modulation techniques (i.e., quadrature amplitude modulation; QAM) for visible light communication (VLC) and pulse-width modulation (PWM) for dimming sources. For the positioning and spreading of brightness, the proof-of-concept was weighted equally over the entire area. Therefore, the receiver plane was analyzed, in order to measure the power of each light-emitting diode (LED) in a given area, using the delayed mean square error (MSE). A framework was applied for the placement of LEDs, using full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) parameters with varying distances. Then, the received power was confirmed. The results show that the AUC using DRMS values for LEDs significantly increased (by 30%) when the number of source LEDs was changed from four to three. These results confirm that our system, associated with the simple linear lateration estimator, can achieve better energy consumption. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

To enhance the traditional MUSIC range estimator for a two-way frequency-hopping Bluetooth channel model, we apply forward-backward averaging and bandwidth extrapolation using Burg's algorithm to improve ranging accuracy, which is limited by the used Bluetooth bandwidth and the quality of the estimated sample covariance matrix. For the multi-antenna case, we compare the Summed Antenna Processing and Individual Antenna Processing methods to process multiple-antenna Bluetooth channel measurements and enhance the range estimation accuracy compared to the single-antenna case. In addition, we investigate a sparsity-aware range estimator which exploits the sparsity of Bluetooth channel impulse response and achieves comparable ranging accuracy to the enhanced MUSIC estimator but at a much lower computational complexity. We apply the greedy Orthogonal Matching Pursuit algorithm to heuristically solve the sparsity-constrained optimization problem for Bluetooth ranging. Furthermore, we evaluate the computational complexity of our investigated Bluetooth range estimators with two complexity-reduction techniques to further reduce the complexity of MUSIC range estimator. Moreover, we analyze the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) on unbiased range estimation using the frequency-hopping Bluetooth channel model and derive a new insightful CRLB expression for a two-path channel model. Finally, we evaluate the Root-Mean-Square Error and Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function performance of our investigated range estimators both on simulated and real-world Bluetooth data that we collected in line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) multipath scenarios.

	abstract = {Objective: Because of the extremely long communication link in deep space, the detection signal is easily affected by channel characteristics such as background light noise and delay jitter, and the output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is very low, which leads to the poor synchronization performance of a receiver. Therefore, it is very important to achieve precise synchronization at low SNR. In general, pulse position modulation (PPM) slot synchronization is mainly in the form of closed-loop tracking, such as phase-locked loop and early-late gate, and the system design is complex. According to the estimation of timing error of the training sequence inserted periodically, the open-loop synchronization is realized, which will waste certain transmitting power. Using the maximum likelihood synchronization method of the guard slot, this method can reduce the computational complexity effectively, however, the bit error rate (BER) will be obvious when the signal power is high. The slot synchronization method of a photon detector array based on photon arrival time measurement requires complexity that is still high. The clock synchronization method based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT) has fast computing speed and the support of underlying hardware. It is suitable for real-time signal processing and has been widely used in wireless communication and optical fiber communication. However, the error of the signal parameters obtained directly from the FFT line spectrum is sometimes very large, which requires frequency correction. However, the single frequency correction method is not robust. We will apply the classical FFT algorithm to the photon-detected PPM communication system in slot synchronization. A method of PPM open-loop synchronization is proposed by selecting the optimal value from the Quinn, Jacobsen, and MacLeod algorithms. To solve the problem that the existing data recovery methods are inaccurate, a data recovery method based on correlation detection is proposed. Methods: The optical PPM signal is sampled asynchronously more than twofold and passed through the FFT, but the error of the signal parameters obtained directly from the FFT line spectrum is sometimes very large, which requires refinement of the frequency estimation. The common frequency correction methods are Rife, Quinn, MacLeod, and Jacobsen. However, the robustness of a single frequency correction method is poor. In this paper, we estimate the initial frequency deviation of the PPM signal using Quinn, Jacobsen, and MacLeod algorithms, and then obtain the time delay deviation. According to the frequency deviation and time delay deviation estimators, the photon number of the PPM signal is recovered through a correlation operation, and then three sets of slot logarithmic likelihood ratio sequences are obtained. Finally, the sequence with the largest standard deviation is selected from these three sets of time slot logarithmic likelihood ratio sequences as the input of the error correction decoder. Results and Discussions: The classical FFT method is applied to slot synchronization of a photon detection PPM communication system. Compared with existing PPM slot synchronization methods, the slot synchronization method proposed in this paper does not need to insert training series, is not limited by the number of guard slots, the system structure is simple, easy to implement by hardware, and the operation speed is fast, PPM slot synchronization can be achieved at very low optical power. The method estimates the initial frequency offset of the signal using the Quinn, Jacobsen, and MacLeod algorithms, and then obtains the time delay deviation of the signal, PPM open-loop synchronization is realized by selecting the optimal value from three ratio methods according to the maximum standard deviation criterion of logarithmic likelihood ratio of slots. Compared with the single ratio method, this method is more robust, and the calculation time is only 1.13 times that of the single ratio method. In this paper, the photon number recovery method based on correlation detection is proposed to verify the high-performance optical PPM experiment based on a multipixel photon counter (MPPC). For 64PPM and fourfold PPM slot frequency asynchronous sampling, the method in this paper only needs to detect 1.33 photons per signal pulse on average, which can make BER less than 10-5. Conclusions: In this paper, an experimental optical PPM communication system based on MPPC is established, and the classical FFT method is applied to the photon detection PPM communication system. Through the maximum standard deviation criterion of the logarithmic likelihood ratio of the slot, the optimal value is selected from the three ratio methods to realize the open-loop synchronization of the PPM slot. Compared with the existing PPM slot synchronization method, the PPM open-loop synchronization method proposed in this paper does not require the insertion of training series and is not limited by the number of guard slots. The system is simple in structure, easy to implement by hardware, and fast in operation speed. PPM slot synchronization can be achieved at extremely low optical power. Compared with the single ratio method, the slot synchronization method is more robust, and the operation time is only 1.13 times that of the single ratio method. In this paper, a photon number recovery method based on correlation detection is proposed to verify the high-performance optical PPM experiment based on MPPC. The experimental results show that the BER performance of the proposed correlation detection algorithm is 0.65 dB and 0.50 dB compared with the ideal simulation data, for the asynchronous sampling signals with twofold and fourfold PPM slot frequency, respectively. For 64PPM and fourfold PPM slot frequency asynchronous sampling, the proposed method in this paper only needs to detect 1.33 photons per signal pulse on average, which can make BER less than 10-5. © 2021, Chinese Lasers Press.

	abstract = {A Seismic Probabilistic Safety Assessment (SPSA), unlike other internal or external event analyses, has a very high probability of basic events when a strong earthquake occurs. Because of this high probability, the Core Damage Frequency (CDF) might be overestimated by the Rare Events Approximation (REA) and Minimal Cutset Upper Bound (MCUB) method for general quantitative analysis. To compensate for this overestimation, the exact CDF value can be derived with post-processing software such as an Advanced Cutset Upper Bound Estimator (ACUBE) or Fault Tree Evaluation using Monte Carlo simulation (FTeMC). However, the Minimal Cut Sets (MCSs), which has the same result as the calculated CDF, cannot be derived with both methods. In this paper, we propose a Monte Carlo Simulation Allocation Method (MCSAM) to derive the exact CDF and MCSs. We expect that the MCSAM will easily identify the plant's vulnerabilities to review the exact MCSs consistent with CDF results without additional post-processing or Monte Carlo Simulation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

Some innovative solutions have been implemented, such as a new and fast tunable laser that permits to color the bursts sent in the TISA network, as well as their transmission with both DP-QPSK and DP-16QAM coherent multi-band (MB) OFDM formats. BER versus OSNR measurements have been achieved showing less than 1-dB penalty in back-to-back or after transmission. The tolerance of bursts against frequency mismatch occurring between the transceiver and the optical filter that extracts a sub-band inside the MB-OFDM signal has also been evaluated, and ∼1.5 GHz tolerance has been measured for bursts of ∼6.7 GHz bandwidth. Furthermore, in order to mitigate the transients in the coherent receiver that faces alternatively the presence or absence of signal, a novel channel estimator based on a sliding window has been introduced. Its efficiency and performance has been experimentally validated, and its ability to suppress the error threshold of the BER versus OSNR curves has been demonstrated. By the experimental proof of concept delivered here, the ability of the TISA network to perform with a good level of performance the transparent routing and sub-wavelength aggregation/disaggregation in the time and spectral domains simultaneously has been established. Beyond the important and crucial aspect of the optimal filling of the optical resources, our PoC demonstrate the ability of the TISA approach to push the flexibility of an optical transport network at its limit while allowing a cost and power consumption limitation obtained by the removal of costly and power-hungry optical-electrical-optical regenerators.  © 1983-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a novel application for the optimal Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) servo controller to enable a proper coordination of the AC/HVDC interconnected system with Virtual Synchronous Power (VSP) based inertia emulation. Particularly, the proposed control design takes the process disturbances and measurement noise of the studied VSP-HVDC system into account, while few studies have focused on this perspective. The proposed LQG controller with modifications is designed by means of a combination of Kalman Filter (state estimator) and an added Linear Quadratic Integrator (LQI) to observe the system model's states and track the reference commands while rejecting the effects of system noise. Besides, we utilize a swarm-based optimization algorithm to operate as the search process for the tuning of the elements in the weighting matrices involved in the controller design. The role of the proposed optimal LQG controller is to stabilize such AC/DC interconnected system with VSP-based inertia emulator while minimizing the associated performance index. According to the obtained simulation results, in addition to the advancement from the VSP-based approach for damping frequency oscillations excited by faults, application of the proposed LQG servo controller can achieve the targets on both estimating the state variables and tracking the reference signals with satisfactory performance, comparing with the conventional LQG regulator. © 2021 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The grid voltage contains the positive sequence, negative sequence and harmonic component under the complex condition of voltage asymmetry, which can cause the great interference to the detection of synchronous sinusoidal signal of the power grid. Therefore, a detection method in a two-phase stationary reference frame is proposed based on extended kalman filter (EKF). Firstly, the Hilbert transform is combined with the Clark transform, and the positive sequence voltage signal is separated by eliminating the negative sequence component using the simple mathematical operation. Secondly, in order to extract the synchronous signal from the separate positive sequence signal, the positive sequence component in the two-phase stationary reference frame is used as the input signal of EKF. This method can not only estimate the positive sequence component of the fundamental wave, but also eliminate the Gaussian white noise of the system, which can more accurately solve the problem of actual working conditions. In this paper, EKF is used to estimate the amplitude and phase of grid voltage synchronization signal. The maximum error of voltage estimation is obviously reduced, compared with other optimized algorithms. Thus, EKF can better estimate the amplitude and phase of the grid voltage fundamental wave. Then, a closed-loop system is designed in this paper. Finally, the simulation and experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can extract grid sinusoidal signals under complex conditions accuracy, and have good frequency adaption characteristics. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {We consider the problem of recovering random graph signals from nonlinear measurements. For this setting, closed-form Bayesian estimators are usually intractable and even numerical evaluation may be difficult to compute for large networks. In this paper, we propose a graph signal processing (GSP) framework for random graph signal recovery that utilizes information on the structure behind the data. First, we develop the GSP-linear minimum mean-squared-error (GSP-LMMSE) estimator, which minimizes the mean-squared-error (MSE) among estimators that are represented as an output of a graph filter. The GSP-LMMSE estimator is based on diagonal covariance matrices in the graph frequency domain, and thus, has reduced complexity compared with the LMMSE estimator. This property is especially important when using the sample-mean estimators that are based on a training dataset. We then state conditions under which the low-complexity GSP-LMMSE estimator coincides with the optimal LMMSE estimator. Next, we develop an approximate parametrization of the GSP-LMMSE estimator by graph filters. We present three implementations of the parametric GSP-LMMSE estimator for typical graph filters. These parametric graph filters are more robust to outliers and to network topology changes. In our simulations, we evaluate the performance of the proposed GSP-LMMSE estimators for the problem of state estimation in power systems, which can be interpreted as a graph signal recovery task. We show that the proposed sample-GSP estimators outperform the sample-LMMSE estimator for a limited training dataset and that the parametric GSP-LMMSE estimators are more robust to topology changes in the form of adding/removing vertices/edges. © 1991-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Open-loop synchronization techniques OLSs can be classified into True (TOLS) and Pseudo or Quasi-OLSs (POLS/QOLS). The TOLS means a system that has no feedback in its structures which results in unconditional stability. Roughly speaking the advanced TOLSs suffers from two main drawbakcks:1) compromising performances under off-nominal frequencies in faulty conditions, 2) inefficiency under large frequency drifts and high computation time. To tackle the problem of frequency adaptivity, the POLS uses a frequency estimator. This technique works efficiently under large frequency drifts even in faulty conditions and benefits from low computation time. However, one of the main challenges in OLS techniques is how to improve dynamic performance without compromising the ability to reject disturbances. In this paper, an enhancement is made to the standard POLS to tackle this problem. The use of a cascade positive fundamental components estimator (PFCE) will allow us to enhance the response time while keeping the phase and magnitude error at their lowest. The mathematical model is presented then simulated. The simulation results validate this proposal. © 2021 IEEE.},

Frequency synchronization is an important problem in power systems as frequency deviation can lead to degraded power quality, tripping of generators, etc. We present a load-estimator-based consensus algorithm in a network of fourth-order generator models that achieves practical frequency synchronization in the presence of unknown time-varying power demand. We do not assume that the demand is generated by a known model. We follow a multiple time-scale approach for the stability analysis. It is shown that synchronization is achieved for the case of constant power demand, by showing that the system is exponentially stable. For the case of time-varying power demand, we show the error trajectories are ultimately bounded, and the synchronization error is proportional to an upper bound on the derivative of the time-varying power demand.

	abstract = {Multipath signals formed by signal reflection coming from objects in the vicinity of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers result in a degradation of the tracking performance and an increase in the positioning error. By estimating the parameters of both line-of-sight signal and the multipath signals, superior multipath mitigation, spoofing suppression, and localization can be attained. We propose using the multiple sparse Bayesian learning method together with the joint angle and delay estimation technique in GNSS multipath environment to fully exploit the sparsity present in both the spatial and the temporal domains. We also extend the techniques to the estimation of fractional Doppler frequency besides the angle and delay. To counteract the intrinsic drawbacks of sparse representations, two different algorithms based on on-grid and off-grid estimators are proposed to either reduce the complexity or enhance the resolution such that the proposed multipath mitigation approach can be adapted to various GNSS practical situations. Subsequently, a third algorithm with improved resolution is obtained by applying the Space Alternating Generalized Expectation–Maximization algorithm to refine the MSBL-based joint angle and delay estimates. Simulation results indicate that the three proposed algorithms can effectively resolve the GNSS multipath signals and have better performance than existing methods even in severe situations, like the cases of signals with low carrier-to-noise-power-density ratio and spatially and temporally correlated multipath. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.},

Firstly, based on the tracking consistency of the multi agent system, taking the system steady-state voltage and angular frequency reference value as the virtual leader and regarding DG(Distributed Generator) as the agent of the multi agent system to achieve the recovered control of the system voltage and angular frequency and the desired active power sharing property. Then, a distributed finite-time event-triggered secondary coordinated control is designed, in which information is exchanged only at the moment of event-triggered time, and the output of the state estimator is used to replace the actual state of DG at the rest time. The Lyapunov method is used to analyze the stability and feasibility of the proposed strategy.

	abstract = {The main purpose of this article is to demonstrate the grid support capability of variable speed hydropower (VSHP). The hypothesis is that active power control of VSHP plants can improve both the frequency stability and the transient rotor angle stability by contributing to virtual inertia (VI), fast frequency reserves and power oscillation damping. Fast active power control is made possible by power electronic converters obtaining the energy from the rotating masses of the turbine and generator while the rotational speed is restored by control of the guide vane opening of the hydro turbine. A detailed dynamic simulation model is developed to simulate the VSHP within the Nordic 44-bus grid model. The VSHP controller includes a moving horizon estimator (MHE), model predictive control (MPC) with inertia emulation realised by the frequency converter of the VSHP plant. The results show that VSHP can contribute significantly to reduce the maximum frequency deviation following a sudden loss of generation. In addition, the amplitudes of power oscillations are reduced and the critical fault clearing times are generally improved. The VSHP should, therefore, be regarded as one of the technically viable options for provision of fast balancing system services. © 1969-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Single-tone and multi-tone transmissions in the narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) uplink system can be accomplished by employing different orthogonal basis. In this paper, we develop an uplink NB-IoT baseband system model and derive the corresponding analytical signal model based on the discrete cosine transform type-I (DCT-I) domain. Basically, the circular convolution and channel matrix diagonalization issues for designing DCT-based systems are addressed without exploiting any redundancy (a prefix and a suffix sequences, and zero-padding (ZP)) into each transmitted data symbol blocks. In our proposed DCT-I based transceiver, we employ a standard cyclic prefix (CP) and apply discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and inverse DFT (IDFT) operations directly to make the channel matrix circulant and diagonal, resulting in the use of one-tap frequency-domain channel equalizer without incorporating extra front-end prefilter at the receiver. Furthermore, we propose novel least squares (LS) and linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) channel estimators by considering the energy concentration and spectral compaction properties of DCT-I for the uplink NB-IoT system. The expressions for the DCT-I domain LS and LMMSE estimators are derived for channel frequency response estimation and mean square error computation. Finally, the viability of the proposed CP-DCT-I-NB-IoT uplink system, as well as the channel estimators, are tested compared with the standardized CP-DFT-NB-IoT and ZP-DCT type-2 even based single-carrier frequency-division multiple access (SC-FDMA) systems through rigorous computer simulations. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

The performance of the proposed controller has been measured on two- and three-area interconnected power systems integrated with a wind turbine generator. A Chebyshev neural network (NN)-based estimator is designed to estimate the lumped system uncertainties, including nonlinearities, unknown external disturbances, and parameter uncertainty. Afterwards, an improved FOISMC is developed, augmenting the estimated output of the NN-based estimator to cope with system disturbances effectively. To corroborate the potential benefits, the results obtained with NN-aided FOISMC (NN-FOISMC) are compared with the outputs of FOISMC and results reported in the literature.

An adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) which is trained by least square estimator and particle swarm optimization (PSO) techniques is implemented to ensure the maximization of the output power at the load. The battery management scheme is designed for charging-discharging control from the battery bank. Three different modes have been executed to regulate the power flow towards the load. A power controller with frequency regulator has been implemented to stabilize the voltage and frequency of the standalone network.

	abstract = {In multi-area interconnected power systems (MAIPS), the measurement of all system states is difficult due to the lack of a sensor or the fact that it is expensive to measure. In order to solve this limitation, a new load frequency controller based on the second-order sliding mode is designed for MAIPS where the estimated state variable is used fully in the sliding surface and controller. Firstly, a model of MAIPS integrated with disturbance is introduced. Secondly, an observer has been designed and used to estimate the unmeasured variables with disturbance. Thirdly, a new second-order sliding mode control (SOSMC) law is used to reduce the chattering in the system dynamics where slide surface and sliding mode controller are designed based on system states observer. The stability of the whole system is guaranteed via the Lyapunov theory. Even though state variables are not measured, the experimental simulation results show that the frequency remains in the nominal range under load disturbances, matched and mismatched uncertainties of the MAIPS. A comparison to other controllers illustrates the superiority of the highlighted controller designed in this paper. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Secondly, based on the priori information on the channel, we derive a maximum a posteriori (MAP) delay-Doppler bins detection method to extract the proper position of the channel taps. Thirdly, in order to circumvent the performance loss incurred by the conventional least squares channel estimation, a novel minimum mean square error (MMSE) delay-Doppler domain channel estimator is constructed, which utilized the information both from the channel power delay profile and the Doppler spectrum.

In this article, a fast and accurate frequency estimator (FE) is developed using a zero crossing and a peak, occurring in the buffered data, unlike the commonly used two zero crossings. Prior to this, the signal is preprocessed using the sliding Goertzel filter (SGF) that mitigates the impact of undesirable features such as harmonics, noise, etc., from the signal. The two FEs, with and without SGF, then work in tandem to form the hybrid estimator and are named as Z_{C}P_{k}-{{HFE}}. The estimated frequency is chosen based on the minimum error computed from the two parallel estimators. The performance of the estimator is, then, validated using the simulated signals polluted with harmonics, noise, transients, etc. The article also discusses the protection-oriented applications of the proposed FE in active distribution network (ADN). Moreover, the evaluation results with the real-time field data and the IEEE-13 ADN incorporated with photovoltaic using dSPACE1104 and real-time digital simulator show its capability to estimate the real-time frequency with satisfactory output.  © 1972-2012 IEEE.},

Uncertainty and Disturbance Estimator (UDE) based control is a robust control method, which often results in instability due to saturation of the integrator. In this paper, a fast charging control strategy for EVs was presented based on the bounded UDE control method. This solution can well handle the uncertainty, disturbances, and input constraints of system between the power grid and charging pile. An additional time-varying variable is introduced into the output dynamic error of bounded controller, to naturally avoid the integrator saturation. Effectively which reduce the harmonic distortion rate of the grid-connected current, can flexibly respond to abnormal grid voltage / frequency events, and improve the stability of grid to a certain extent. The control method can effectively respond to the impact of EV fast charging interface on power grid, improve the adaptability of power grid to large-scale EV access. Based on the given control strategy, PSCAD / EMTDC is used for simulation tests, and a 50kW prototype experiment proves the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed fast charge control scheme.  © 2021 IEEE.},

Although the power deficit is not the state variable in the network mathematical model, the solution of estimation problem was feasible by introducing the new variable using additional dummy system.

This e-bike charger is realized by a Cuk converter followed by a LLC resonant converter with an improved power quality (PQ) input current indices. The pulsewidth modulated Cuk converter is operated in discontinuous conduction mode of its output side inductor, which leads to a voltage follower approach for input current shaping. Thus, the control loop is greatly simplified as it consists of a single voltage loop. The e-bike battery charging algorithm is implemented in variable frequency controlled HB LLC resonant converter followed by a diode rectification at its output stage. Furthermore, a 550 W, constant current/constant voltage charger with a maximum current rating of 10 A is developed to charge a 20AH e-bike battery. A variable dc link reference voltage estimator is presented, which varies the dc link voltage and extends the output voltage range for charging e-bike battery of varying voltage rating from 42-80V. Moreover, a resonant frequency optimizer loop is also proposed, which reduces the turn-off losses during charging a deeply discharged battery. The behavior of this charger is exhaustively analyzed under steady state and transient conditions and the PQ at the input, is found to comply the international standard of IEC-61\,000-3-2.  © 1972-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Fast harmonic phasor measurements are very useful in power system protection applications, e.g., high-impedance fault location and intelligent method-based islanding detection. To address this problem, a novel harmonic phasor estimator is proposed in this paper, especially for P-class phasor measurement units (PMUs). The exponential functions are used to model the decaying dc (ddc) component, and the optimal time constant (TC) set for the ddc model is searched based on an enumeration method. In addition, the dynamic harmonic phasors are modeled based on the Shannon sampling theorem. As a result, a filter bank is designed for harmonic phasor and frequency estimations. The rate of change of frequency (ROCOF) of the harmonic is estimated based on a second-order fitting method. The response time of the proposed method for harmonic phasor estimation is always no longer than 40 ms. Simulation test results indicate that the proposed method is more accurate than the Taylor-Fourier transform (TFT) under ddc offset and frequency deviation conditions. In particular, the proposed method is more robust to ddc's TC variations. An experimental test is implemented to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method. © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

The algorithm requires the sampling of high-frequency harmonics in the DC-DC converted voltage and current signals (in the order of several hundred kHz), which make their acquisition and processing unwieldy for typical small embedded systems, mainly if aiming at low latency, efficiency control loops for several panels. As such, the presented system provides with fast sampling (1Mbps per channel), fast processing, expandable parametric estimation, and online monitoring, using an Avnet ZedBoard Zynq SoC platform.

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider pilot-aided channel estimation and equalization for single-carrier and single-carrier frequency division multiple-access (SC-FDMA) transmission over doubly-selective channels (DSC). To reduce the channel estimation (CE) parameters, the DSC is modelled using a complex-exponential basis expansion model (CX-BEM) with non-uniform BEM frequencies. We optimize the CX-BEM basis functions using CE error minimization as the objective. As a result, the channel modelling error is greatly reduced. Next, we propose a BEM-based per-survivor processing (PSP) technique and combine it with a decision-directed channel estimator to obtain a channel-tracking equalizer at the receiver. The resultant BEM-PSP receiver significantly improves the channel estimation mean square error (MSE) and the bit error rates (BER) performance in fast fading multi-path channel, thanks to the channel tracking capability embedded within its Viterbi equalizer. Finally, we employ cross-frame channel interpolation, and power distribution between the data and pilot symbols to further improve the system performance at high fading rates. Extensive simulation results show that our BEM-PSP receiver outperforms many existing methods and approaches close to an ideal receiver with perfectly known CSI under various fading scenarios. © 2002-2012 IEEE.},

In such systems, carrier synchronization is important yet has not received much attention. In this paper, we develop and analyze deep learning architectures for estimating the carrier frequency of a complex sinusoid in noise from the 1-bit samples of the in-phase and quadrature components. Carrier frequency offset estimation from a sinusoid is used in GSM and is a first step towards developing a more comprehensive solution with other kinds of signals. We train four different deep learning architectures each on eight datasets which represent possible training considerations. Specifically, we consider how training with various signal to noise ratios (SNR), quantization, and sequence lengths affects estimation error. Further, we analyze each architecture in terms of scalability for MIMO receivers. In simulations, we compare execution time and mean squared error (MSE) versus classic signal processing techniques. We demonstrate that training with quantized data, drawn from signals with SNRs between 0-10dB tends to improve deep learning estimator performance across the entire SNR range of interest. We conclude that convolutional models have the best performance, while also requiring shorter execution time than FFT methods. Our approach is able to accurately estimate carrier frequencies from 1-bit quantized data with fewer pilots and lower signal to noise ratios (SNRs) than traditional signal processing methods. © 2020 IEEE.},

This paper is concerned with estimation of multiple frequencies with prior knowledge from incomplete and/or noisy samples. Suppose that it is known a priori that the frequencies lie in some given intervals, we develop efficient super-resolution estimators by exploiting such prior knowledge based on frequency-selective (FS) atomic norm minimization. We study the MD Vandermonde decomposition of block Toeplitz matrices in which the frequencies are restricted to lie in given intervals. We then propose to solve the FS atomic norm minimization problems for the low-rank spectral tensor recovery by converting them into semidefinite programs based on the MD Vandermonde decomposition. We also develop fast solvers for solving these semidefinite programs via the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), where each iteration involves a number of refinement steps to utilize the prior knowledge. Extensive simulation results are presented to illustrate the high performance of the proposed methods. © 1983-2012 IEEE.},

The framework denoises a signal that consists of a weighted sum of an unknown number of time-delayed and frequency-shifted unknown waveforms from its noisy measurements. Moreover, the framework also provides an approach for estimating the unknown parameters in the signal. We prove that when the number of the observed samples satisfies certain lower bound that is a function of the system parameters, we can estimate the noise-free signal, with very high accuracy, upon solving a regularized least-squares atomic norm minimization problem. We derive the theoretical mean-squared error of the estimator, and we show that it depends on the noise variance, the number of unknown waveforms, the number of samples, and the dimension of the low-dimensional space where the unknown waveforms lie. Finally, we verify the theoretical findings of the paper by using extensive simulation experiments.  © 1991-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {One of the fundamental concerns in the operation of modern power systems is the assessment of their frequency stability in case of inertia-reduction induced by the large share of power electronic interfaced resources. Within this context, the paper proposes a framework that, by making use of linear models of the frequency response of different types of power plants, including also grid-forming and grid-following converters, is capable to infer a numerically tractable dynamical model to be used in frequency stability assessment. Furthermore, the proposed framework makes use of models defined in a way such that their parameters can be inferred from real-time measurements feeding a classical least squares estimator. The paper validates the proposed framework using a full-replica of the dynamical model of the IEEE 39 bus system simulated in a real-time platform. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

In this paper, we present a novel two-step framework to estimate these parameters for both single-phase and three-phase power systems including harmonics and interharmonics. After employing a harmonic version of the Aboutanios and Mulgrew (HAM) estimator, the fundamental frequency and phase estimates are further refined by a weighted least squares (WLS) estimator. The WLS refinement step takes advantage of the harmonic and interharmonic relationships to further improve the parameter estimation from the HAM step. Consequently, the proposed HAM-WLS method maintains accuracy even in electrically-noisy environments that are also contaminated with both harmonics and interharmonics. Results from both simulated and real data under various power system conditions verify that the HAM-WLS estimator outperforms state-of-the-art estimation methods in terms of accuracy, complexity and convergence. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {When using an electron microscope for imaging of particles embedded in vitreous ice, the recorded image, or micrograph, is a significantly degraded version of the tomographic projection of the sample. Apart from noise, the image is affected by the optical configuration of the microscope. This transformation is typically modeled as a convolution with a point spread function. The Fourier transform of this function, known as the contrast transfer function (CTF), is oscillatory, attenuating and amplifying different frequency bands, and sometimes flipping their signs. High-resolution reconstruction requires this CTF to be accounted for, but as its form depends on experimental parameters, it must first be estimated from the micrograph. We present a new method for CTF estimation based on multitaper techniques that reduce bias and variance in the estimate. We also use known properties of the CTF and the background power spectrum to further reduce the variance through background subtraction and steerable basis projection. We show that the resulting power spectrum estimates better capture the zero-crossings of the CTF and yield accurate CTF estimates on several experimental micrographs. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The hybrid architecture still be the most attractive solution for the analog-digital beamforming in millimeter wave (mmWave) large-scale multiple input multiple output (LS-MIMO) systems, since it provides the best trade-off between the achievable rate and the power consumption. When maximizing performance metrics, channel knowledge is required to optimally design the hybrid beamforming. The channel estimation (CE) is essential for wideband mmWave LS-MIMO to substantially enhance data rates, however, is a challenging task. Practically, the antenna number and the bandwidth for such communications are very large. Therefore, the CE scheme should account for the frequency-dependence of the array response vectors and thereby the beam squint effect. In the first part, this article addresses a structured analysis compressive sensing (CS) for CE in a frequency selective mmWave LS-MIMO system without neglecting the beam squint effect. Compared to sparse mmWave CE approach that mostly uses on-grid dictionaries, our proposed approach considers continually distributed angles of arrival and departure. In the second part, we show that the frequency-selective mmWave MIMO channels share a common sparsity structure within the same subcarrier-group. Then, we propose a block-sparsity-based CS approach that uses the simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit method to estimate the mmWave channel. Moreover, we prove the partial sparsity structure shared between all the subcarrier-groups. Hence, we develop our proposed joint subcarrier-block-based CE scheme exploiting these two block-sparsity structures. Numerical results evaluate the performances in terms of normalized mean-squared error and spectral efficiency to select the most accurate channel estimator with lower overhead. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Synchronized phasor and frequency measurements are key tools for the monitoring and management of modern power systems. Under dynamic conditions, it is vital to define algorithms that allow accurately measuring time-varying signals with short latencies and high reporting rates. A dynamic phasor model can help the design of these algorithms and, in particular, of those based on the Kalman filter approach. This article proposes a three-phase synchrophasor estimator based on the extended Kalman filter; state variables are obtained from Taylor expansions of amplitudes and phase angles. The underlying dynamic model considers the inherent relationship among the phases and includes harmonics in an effective way. The process noise covariance matrix that allows representing the uncertainty introduced by the dynamic model has been written by considering that practical ac power systems are nearly three-phase symmetric during typical operation. This a priori information allows improving noise rejection and increasing accuracy in the presence of amplitude modulation, as highlighted by the reported simulation results.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Synchronous phasor measurements have long been an important tool in power flow modelling and network state estimation as well as in many other tasks that support power grid observability. Classic phasor estimation algorithms are often preferred over complex alternatives. They are based on a variant of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) while relying on a sampling frequency locked to the system nominal frequency. The spectral leakage caused by the small off-nominal frequency excursions in such settings introduces errors that are handled by the estimation algorithms to a different extent. Well-known three-point averaging filter (3P) is a low-cost spectral leakage reduction technique in one of the simplest estimators based on a single-bin DFT. However, it only partially removes the oscillating components. When an independent standard-based frequency tracking is available, the errors can be further compensated with minimal cost. We propose a frequency-corrected three-point estimator (F3P) to eliminate the induced spurious spectrum progressively with the increasing sampling rate while building on the analytical expression of the remaining error. We show performance benefits of the F3P under finite sampling rates when compared to the baseline 3P and to the classical Interpolated DFT (IPDFT) in static conditions. The F3P removes most of the leakage without the need of data resampling. In less ideal conditions with additive 50-dB noise, up to a 10-fold reduction of the 3P error is achieved. The error ratio of the reference IPDFT over the F3P is approximately 1.4 under the same conditions and largely independent of the frequency excursion. The presented simulation results prove the algorithm's superior performance in most of the steady-state tests defined by the relevant Standard, whereas the dynamic performance can be brought to an acceptable level by the use of a single-cycle observation window, with the response times comparable to those of the IPDFT.  © 2013 IEEE.},

This paper presents a modified direct torque control of asynchronous motor scheme associated to sinusoidal pulse width modulation and PI regulators to generate the system voltages. In the other hand and instead of using a two-level inverter, the asynchronous motor is fed by a three-level inverter in order to reduce stress of the power device and to enhance output quality. In addition, the control strategy uses a speed estimator that allows the elimination of the mechanical sensor, which greatly increases the reliability of the system.

The active and reactive power can be estimated based on the virtual flux vector that makes AC line voltage sensors not necessary. A constant converter switching frequency is achieved by employing a multilevel space vector modulation, which ensures the balance of the DC capacitor voltages of the five-level t-type converters as well.

	abstract = {Partial discharge is one of the main reasons of electrical equipment insulation deterioration in substations. The detection and localization of partial discharge (PD) using ultra-high frequency (UHF) antennas is an important means for equipment fault warning in substations. UHF PD localization system is usually based on time-difference of electromagnetic wave signal. However, this system requires high sampling rate and time synchronization accuracy, which has high cost. This paper studied the feasibility and accuracy of PD direction of arrival (DoA) using power of UHF received signal strength indicator (RSSI) and maximum likelihood (ML) estimation. First, the UHF antenna power pattern was achieved in the offline experiment. Then, a method using maximum likelihood estimator was proposed to handle PD direction of arrival estimation and obtain the preliminary orientation results. Last, in order to obtain the final results, interpolation and clustering were employed to improve the resolution. In a laboratory test, the experimental results show that the average error of direction of arrival is less than 7°, and the cost is lower and the use is more convenient. © 2020, Electrical Technology Press Co.

It is shown through simulations that the proposed search method significantly outperforms the existing tuning methods such as Tree Parzen Estimators (TPE).

	abstract = {In the last decade, functional connectivity (FC) has been increasingly adopted based on its ability to capture statistical dependencies between multivariate brain signals. However, the role of FC in the context of brain-computer interface applications is still poorly understood. To address this gap in knowledge, we considered a group of 20 healthy subjects during an EEG-based hand motor imagery (MI) task. We studied two well-established FC estimators, i.e. spectral- and imaginary-coherence, and we investigated how they were modulated by the MI task. We characterized the resulting FC networks by extracting the strength of connectivity of each EEG sensor and we compared the discriminant power with respect to standard power spectrum features. At the group level, results showed that while spectral-coherence based network features were increasing in the sensorimotor areas, those based on imaginary-coherence were significantly decreasing. We demonstrated that this opposite, but complementary, behavior was respectively determined by the increase in amplitude and phase synchronization between the brain signals. At the individual level, we eventually assessed the potential of these network connectivity features in a simple off-line classification scenario. Taken together, our results provide fresh insights into the oscillatory mechanisms subserving brain network changes during MI and offer new perspectives to improve BCI performance. © 2021 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

	abstract = {In orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) systems, channel estimation (CE) is often performed using a pilot based approach. This is usually done in two steps: first, valid channel paths are detected by comparing the magnitude of received symbols against a threshold, and then the associated channel coefficient is estimated. In an attempt to avoid channel path misdetection, existing approaches often deploy large guard bands surrounding a relatively high-power pilot symbol. Furthermore, it is generally assumed that this guard region is sufficiently large to ensure that the time/frequency spreading of the channel does not result in any interference between the pilot and data symbols, thus facilitating simple channel estimation schemes. In this paper, we propose a channel estimation scheme which works even when this assumption is no longer true, i.e., when the channel results in pilot-data interference as may occur in scenarios involving high mobility and/or large delay-spread. The ability of a receiver to operate in such scenarios allows system designers the freedom to use smaller guard bands based on typical (not worst-case) channel spread parameters, thereby yielding higher spectral efficiency. In this work, we derive a maximum likelihood channel path detection scheme followed by a minimum mean-square error channel estimator. The performance advantage of the proposed receiver is verified using extensive bit error rate simulations. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In the fifth-generation (5G) high-speed train (HST) system operating in the millimeter-wave (mmWave) band, a much higher Doppler shift occurs. Doppler shift severely degrades reception performance in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based wireless communication systems. The performance of the Doppler shift estimator is directly related to safety in the HST because the 5G HST system is used for train control. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a fast and accurate Doppler shift estimator (DSE) with low complexity. In this paper, we propose a new machine learning-based DSE (MLDSE). Taking note of the fact that an HST travels the same path repeatedly, the MLDSE estimates the Doppler shift by using the reference signal received power (RSRP) values measured by the mobile receiver at all times. However, since there is a one-to-many mapping problem when the RSRP values reflecting the 5G beam sweeping and selection correspond to Doppler shifts, machine learning cannot be performed. To solve this problem, we design an RSRP ambiguity reducer (AR) for the machine learning input so that the pattern of RSRP values can be mapped and learned into corresponding Doppler shifts. As a result, MLDSE can estimate Doppler shift more accurately than any HST DSEs known to the authors. In addition, an MLDSE consisting of only three layers is superior to the conventional techniques in terms of computational complexity as well as estimation accuracy.  © 1967-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The study suggests a method aimed to improve the performance of practical grid-connected converters connected to distorted mains, utilising total uncertainty and disturbance estimator (TUDE) based control structures with time-delay filter. Such a TUDE filter enhances disturbance rejection performance by possessing near-unity magnitude and near-zero phase at integer multiples of the base frequency, imposing repetitive-control-alike behaviour. However, it is well-known that in repetitive control, disturbance rejection at mid-frequencies, were non-periodic disturbances and noise may exist, is deteriorated. This study presents an enhancement, allowing to retain good disturbance rejection at mid-frequencies within the low-frequency portion of control bandwidth (relevant in practical systems) while trading-off the performance in the high-frequency control bandwidth part. The proposed methodology is verified by application to output current control of LCL-filter based inverter feeding distorted AC mains. The validity and performance of the proposed methodology are well-supported by simulations and experiments. © 2020 Institution of Engineering and Technology. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Overdispersion is a common phenomenon in count or frequency responses in Poisson models. For example, number of car accidents on a highway during a year period. A similar phenomenon is observed in electric power systems, where cascading failures often follows some distribution with inflated zero. When the response contains an excess amount of zeros, zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) is the most favourable model. However, during the data collection process, some of the covariates cannot be accessed directly or are measured with error among numerous disciplines. To the best of our knowledge, little existing work is available in the literature that tackles the population heterogeneity in the count response while some of the covariates are measured with error. With the increasing popularity of such outcomes in modern studies, it is interesting and timely to study zero-inflated Poisson models in which some of the covariates are subject to measurement error while some are not. We propose a flexible partial linear single index model for the log Poisson mean to correct bias potentially due to the error in covariates or the population heterogeneity. We derive consistent and locally efficient semiparametric estimators and study the large sample properties. We further assess the finite sample performance through simulation studies. Finally, we apply the proposed method to a real data application and compare with existing methods that handle measurement error in covariates. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

The presented analytical solution is composed by two interdependent processes. First, fault distance is estimated through a Weighted Least Square approach applied to solve an overdetermined and nonlinear algebraic system of equations. Second, an analytical method based on the statistical behavior of the estimates obtained from the frequency domain system model solution is presented to address the multiple estimates problem, identifying the faulted section. The presented fault location physics-based analytical model considers the capacitive effect of distribution lines. Furthermore, voltages and currents measured from only one terminal are used. The formulation is evaluated using the IEEE 13-bus and a modified version of the IEEE 34-bus test feeders. Comparative analysis with state-of-the-art methods is presented. Average errors of 1.95% are obtained.

Each slot of the FHSS experiences frequency-selective fading and unequal transceiver-frequency gains that hinder the detection of jammed slots and result in a poor bit-error rate (BER).

Second, we developed a jammer detector based on gamma distribution, and designed a restoration method combining all nonjammed slots. Computer simulations verified the derived NCRB of the proposed NJPE by normalized mean squared error (NMSE), and showed that the jammer-detection probability of the proposed jammer detector was better than that of conventional detectors. The BER performance of the proposed method was also shown to be better than that of conventional methods. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Power-Line Communication (PLC) employs multi-carrier modulations, such as Filter-Bank Multi-Carrier (FBMC), to improve communications through the PLC channel and provide an efficient use of the spectrum, thus allowing higher data rates. Since one of the main drawbacks is the noisy channel with multipath and frequency-selective fading, the receiver typically includes a channel estimator and equalizer, at the expense of increasing the computational load and complexity of that receiver and making it difficult to obtain real-time solutions. In this context, this work proposes a heterogeneous System-on-Chip (SoC) architecture for the real-time implementation of a FBMC transmultiplexer that involves the channel estimation and equalization at the reception stage. For that purpose, the performance of a multicore approach is evaluated for both the Zynq R 7000 SoC and the Zynq R UltraScaleC (USC) devices, by using a single-, dual- A nd quad-core solution to perform the channel estimation and the calculation of the equalizer coefficients in the ARM processor available in the proposed architecture. Two approaches have been analysed for the necessary synchronization among cores; one based on atomic instructions and the other one on interrupts. The dual-core proposal in both Zynq R 7000 and Zynq R USC provides a x2 acceleration compared to the single-core proposal, whereas the quad-core one in Zynq R USC does not provide a x4 acceleration as expected, due to the timing overheads of the synchronization among cores imposed by the data dependencies existing in these tasks. Experimental results include the evaluation of the processing times for each task in the algorithm, as well as the acceleration obtained by each proposal. The proposed architecture can be easily applied to other processing algorithms that may take advantage of the parallelism provided by the multi-core approach in a more efficient way, depending on their data dependencies. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

	abstract = {Power inverters are widely used in grid connected applications, specially with the increasing use of renewable energies, to improve power quality and increase efficiency. However some parameter associated to the grid and/or the inverters, such as the grid frequency, needs to be known or properly estimated. This estimation introduces an uncertainty in the system and suffer transients due to the estimator. Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) control can be used to account for those uncertainties. This paper presents a feedback control based on a LPV control law to improve the power quality of a grid connected Current Source Inverter (CSI), significantly reducing the total harmonic distortion (THD) of the grid generator current. A linear model of the interconnection is presented, where the frequency of the grid is assumed variable being estimated together with its phase through a Phase Locked Loop (PLL). The LPV control law is implemented through state feedback achieving both, harmonic suppression and reference tracking, using the estimation of the frequency of the PLL. Implicitly, this allows for the estimation of the magnitude and phase of the harmonic distortion canceling it up to the CSI current limit. An analytic proof of the filtering guarantees of the method is presented along with simulation results that show the practical viability of this technique. It is shown that this control approach is capable of an appealing adaptation to changes in the frequency of the power grid with a low computational burden being able to also cope with disturbances in the estimation of the frequency due to the PLL..  © 2003-2012 IEEE.},

This problem can be mitigated by using adaptive modulation scheme depending on SNR values estimated by channel estimator. In this paper, a simple model of OFDM-SIM with adaptive modulation is proposed. Switching decision is implemented by fuzzy interface system.

	abstract = {A frequency lock loop (FLL) based steady state linear Kalman filter (SSLKF) for unified power quality conditioner (UPQC) control in three-phase systems is introduced. The SSLKF provides a highly accurate and fast estimation of grid frequency and the fundamental components (FCs) of the input signals. The Kalman filter is designed using an optimized filtering technique and intrinsic adaptive bandwidth architecture, and is easily integrated into a multiple model system. Therefore, the Kalman state estimator is fast and simple. The fundamental positive sequence components (FPSCs) of the grid voltages in a UPQC system are estimated via these SSLKF-FLL based filters. The estimation of reference signals for a UPQC controller is based on these FPSCs. Therefore, both active filters of a UPQC can perform one and more functions towards improving power quality in a distribution network. In addition to the SSLKF-FLL based algorithm, a bat optimization algorithm (based on the echolocation phenomenon of bats) is implemented to estimate the value of the proportional integral (PI) controller gains. The bat algorithm has a tendency to automatically zoom into a region where a promising alternative solution occurs, preventing the solution from becoming trapped in a local minima. The complete three-phase UPQC is simulated in the Matlab/Simulink platform and the hardware is tested under various power quality problems.  © 2017 CMP.},

	abstract = {In this study, the four landslide susceptibility (LS) mapping methods, frequency ratio (FR), analytic hierarchy process (AHP), artificial neural networks (ANN) and fuzzy logic (FL) method, are compared. The study has been conducted in Taşkent (Konya, Turkey) Basin which is located between 36.88 N to 36.95 N latitudes and 32.35 E to 32.53 E longitudes. The survey area is approximately 80 km2. The FR, AHP, ANN and FL methods are used to map LS. Thematic layers of fourteen landslide conditioning factors including landslide inventory, elevation, slope, slope aspect, plan, and profile curvature, sediment loading factor, stream power, and wetness index, drainage, and fault density, distance to drainage, and fault, geological units, and land use-land cover are used for preparing the LS maps. Estimation power of models has been evaluated by the relative operating characteristic curve method. The areas under the curve for FR, AHP, ANN and FL method have been computed as 0.926, 0.899, 0.916 and 0.842, respectively. These results showed that FR method is relatively good, whereas FL method is a relatively poor estimator for susceptibility. The validity of the LS maps was evaluated by test landslides. The 58 test landslides (76 pixels), 43 training landslides (200 pixels), and 101 total landslides (276 pixels) have been put onto the LS maps prepared by the various methods. The percentages of the existing landslide pixels within the different landslide occurrence potential classes were determined. It is determined that a significant portion of all landslides (76% in the ANN, 83% in the FR, 87% in the AHP and 89% in the FL method) belong to the high and very high LS class. The produced four susceptibility maps were also compared using cross-correlation methods. The cross-correlation coefficients were found to be 0.82, 0.70, 0.63, 0.54, 0.48, and 0.45 for AHP versus FR, FR versus FL, AHP versus FL, AHP versus ANN, FR versus ANN, and FL versus ANN maps, respectively.

In this paper, a distributed control strategy integrated with multi-agent-based average consensus algorithm is presented for the Distributed Energy Storage Systems (DESS) in islanded AC micro-grid. A hierarchical control structure is implemented that consists of three control levels, i.e.: inner controls, primary controls, and secondary controls. The secondary control layer consists of estimators for injected power, SoC, and system frequency. Power sharing is achieved with SoC based adaptive droop control. The multi-agent based average consensus algorithm is implemented to obtain average estimate of SoC, frequency and active power. A voltage compensation method is given to ensure that the voltage of PCC is within the acceptable range. The simulation studies carried out, verify that the proposed control strategy can ensure accurate power sharing among DESS and restore voltage and frequency to a nominal accepted range. © 2020 IEEE},

	abstract = {Lithium-ion batteries have been treated as the most efficient energy storage candidates in electric vehicles. However, range anxiety hinders its popularity in daily transportation. When compared with the extensively discussed state-of-charge, state-of-energy (SoE) is a more appropriate indicator of remaining driving mileage by considering the voltage degradation in the discharging process. In this paper, an equivalent circuit model (ECM) based SoE estimator is proposed where a pseudo power definition is utilized to exclude the internal loss influence, and an unscented particle filter is employed to address system nonlinearities and noises. Additionally, to accommodate battery time-variant characteristics, the ECM parameters and variables are decoupled in complex-frequency domain, upon which the recursive least square algorithm is utilized for the on-line identification of parameters. Finally, a series of validation experiments on a LiFePO4 battery verify that the proposed methodology can track the real SoE closely with an error of less than 1.8%. © 2020, The Korean Institute of Power Electronics.},

	abstract = {In this research work, a deep learning (DL)-based method for the fast and accurate analysis of current harmonics of electric arc furnaces (EAF) is proposed. For such a system, a large amount of EAF current data is required for the training phase of the DL-based structure, which is not only a thorny but also an expensive procedure. Hence, the second focus of this research work is to gain the ability to generate EAF currents with realistic harmonic contents based on a much smaller amount of field data of EAF currents. For this purpose, EAF current data, recorded at a transformer substation supplying an EAF plant during a tap-to-tap time of the EAF operation, are examined in terms of harmonic component amplitudes and phases. Then, a significantly larger amount of EAF current data is regenerated based on the statistics of current harmonics mimicking the real EAF behavior and this synthetic data are used to train the DL-based harmonic estimator. This estimator is able to estimate both amplitudes and phases of the harmonics without computing any time- or frequency-domain features during the estimation process. Hence, the outcomes of this research work are twofold: First, detailed analysis of the EAF current harmonic behavior is achieved, which reveals the operation principles of the EAF. Second, a DL-based harmonic estimator is trained, which is able to output the amplitude and phase estimations directly out of waveform samples without any feature extraction. The proposed system aims to serve the needs of active power filters of the EAF installations in the electricity system, since it has been shown that fast and accurate harmonic amplitude and phase estimations are obtained.  © 1972-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {TeraHertz (THz) communication has drawn increasing interest from both academic and industrial fields due to its capability of attaining data transmission over 100 Gb/s. To generate THz-band carriers, one promising low-cost electronic approach is the frequency-multiplier-last architecture, which however induces undesirable nonlinearity. Another substantial issue in THz communication systems is the residual hardware impairment in the mixer and power amplifier (PA), which are usually neglected under low-rate scenarios, but considered to be pronounced in the ultra-high-speed THz wireless links. With the existence of all these radio-frequency (RF) imperfections at the transmitter, conventional receiver design for lower-frequency bands is no longer applicable. In this paper, a single-carrier THz communication system utilizing the frequency-multiplier-last architecture is investigated. By jointly considering the overall RF imperfections of the mixer, the PA, and the frequency multiplier at the transmitter, a sophisticated mathematical model of the induced distortions on transmitted THz signals is provided. Based on the model, a low-complexity closed-form minimum mean Euclidean distance (MMED) channel estimator is firstly derived. Afterwards, the aggregate distortions plus thermal noise on the THz signals are approximated as a signal-dependent and spatially-colored noise term, where a closed-form quasi-maximum-likelihood (quasi-ML) detector is developed for the THz communication system. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed receiver design is capable of significantly enhancing the performance of the THz system compared with its conventional counterparts, in terms of channel estimation accuracy and bit-error rate (BER). © 2020 IEEE.},

At the receiver, we propose a sparsity-learning based iterative algorithm for distortion compensation by exploiting the sparsity of the distortion. Specifically, our iterative algorithm consists of a linear estimator, a soft demodulator, and a distortion estimator. The iteration between the three modules is based on turbo message passing.

However, these filters may produce a large estimation error when the frequency deviation from the nominal value is high. Online calculation of the FIR filter bank coefficients may improve the estimation accuracy but at the cost of increased computational complexity. To address this issue, in this article, we propose a dynamic harmonic estimation algorithm that aims to enhance measurement accuracy at both nominal and off-nominal frequencies and has a reduced computational complexity.

For Two-core Symmetric Phase Angle Regulators, this article investigates the suitability of time and time-frequency feature-based estimators to differentiate internal faults from other transient conditions such as overexcitation, external faults with current transformer (CT) saturation, and magnetizing inrush. Subsequently, the faulty core unit (series or exciting) is located, and the transients are identified. Six well-known classifiers are trained on features extracted from one-cycle of post transient 3-phase differential currents filtered by an event detector. Maximum Relevance Minimum Redundancy, Random Forest, and exhaustive search with Decision Trees are used to select the relevant wavelet energy, time-domain, and wavelet coefficient features respectively. The fault detection scheme trained on XGBoost classifier with hyperparameters obtained from Bayesian Optimization gives an accuracy of 99.8%. The reliability of the proposed scheme is verified with varying tap positions, noise levels, and transformer ratings; and under different conditions like CT saturation, fault during magnetizing inrush, series core saturation, low current faults, and integration of wind energy.

	abstract = {Low resolution data converters can enable power efficient high bandwidth communication at millimeter-wave and terahertz frequencies. Synchronization of such systems is a critical step in accurate decoding, yet current approaches require long block lengths or fail to reach the Cramer Rao Bound (CRB).Prior solutions have traditionally been divided into two distinct focuses: algorithms and designed sequences for synchronization. In this paper, we develop a jointly optimized neural architecture for frequency synchronization from configurable sequences and estimators. Our proposed technique uses two neural networks to generate sequences and determine the carrier frequency offset of the sequence after propagating through a channel and applying one-bit quantization. Our simulations show that we can improve estimation performance at low signal to noise ratio (SNR) by up to 8dB at little cost compared to the same estimator without the sequence generator. Our proposed system is fast, efficient, and easily updated, allowing it to handle time-varying systems. In conclusion, we believe further investigation in jointly optimized pilot sequences and estimators will be fundamental to handling signal processing techniques with low resolution data converters. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With the rapid growth of renewable energy resources, wind energy system is getting more interest everywhere throughout the world. However, its extensive use in power systems prompts many power system dynamics and stability problems. Load variation and anomalous operating conditions prompt inconsistencies in frequency and planned power trades. These inconsistencies should be remedied by load frequency control. This paper introduces a novel frequency control system utilizing a mix of adaptive model predictive controller (AMPC) and recursive polynomial model estimator (RPME) integrated with double fed induction generator wind turbines. Inside each control duration, the RPME is identifying a discrete-time online autoregressive exogenous model. The latter is used through the AMPC to update the interior plant model in order to achieve a successful nonlinear control. The performance of the proposed system has been verified and contrasted with the conventional MPC system through a computer simulation-based MATLAB/SIMULINK. The simulation results demonstrated the superiority of the proposed system as for the conventional MPC system. © 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {This article proposes a novel technique for fundamental and selective harmonic phasor estimation of a single-phase voltage signal based on open-loop voltage signal processing approach, under adverse distorted conditions. At heart, a modified fast discrete Stockwell transform (FDST) is used for the phasor estimation. The performance of the FDST is improved by incorporating a new frequency-dependent Gaussian window for capturing the time-localized variations of individual frequency component. The modified window has four parameters, which are selected based on the statistical properties of the given input voltage signal. Furthermore, under off-nominal frequency conditions the spectral leakage problem, faced by the S-transform, is avoided by proposing a modified sample value adjustment based preprocessing stage. Various static and dynamic tests were considered according to the IEEE Standard 1159, IEEE Standard C37.118.1a-2014, and EN-50160 standards under harmonics and interharmonics scenarios. The performance of the proposed method is validated using synthetic voltage signals, simulated voltage signals on 6-bus microgrid model developed in power system computer aided design (PSCAD), and hardware implementation on dSPACE 1103. The rigorous test cases reveal that the proposed phasor measurement unit has a good adaptability to grid frequency drifts, a good harmonic and dc-offset rejection capability, and a very good steady state as well as dynamic response. © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Frictionless magnetic bearings can contribute to modern agricultural equipment, such as pump, fan and blast, thereby to achieve high efficiency, energy-saving and long-term reliable operation. But magnetic bearings are confined to the configuration and price of position sensors. In the recent years, the self-sensing and sensor less mode have been developed to extend the application of the magnetic bearings. Most previous studies are focused on the estimation algorithms, such as the state observer approach and parameter estimation approach. Moreover, the extra phase-shift is introduced by the estimator which consists of the analogue filter or FIR or more complex mathematic algorithm. The self-sensing path turns complex and longer due to the fundmental ripple needs to be extracted, amplified and filtered. Therefore, the key research target of this paper is the operation of position estimation. An absolute mathermatical approach was proposed to extract the rotor positon using the zero ripple characteristic based on the cosine-function of coil current. A self-sensing algorithm based on SS-DCE (Synchronous-Sampling-based Discrete Current Estimator) can be used to remove the extra phase that introduced by the analog or digital filters of the sensing path. Synchronous-sampling technique was used to sample the coil working current in the estimator due to PWM switching harmonics without the discrete current. Moreover, the phase shift can be minimized in SS-DCE scheme because the filters of amplitude demodulation have been eliminated, and the configure of AMBs are simplified. The numerical results of SS-DCE were also compare with that of the digital filtering amplitude demodulation approach(DFAdM). The test results of the position estimators showed that the optimal performances can be obtained, when the switching frequency and synchronous sampling frequency are 2 kHz, control frequency is 50 Hz, sampling frequency of DFAdM is 100 kHz, and some electrical conditions as the bias current 3.0 A, nominal inductance 13.2 mH and power supply 50 V. The SS-DCE was also verified by the simulation in 1-DOF AMBs. The static performance evalution was performed on the proposed estimator, indicating that the precision of SS-DCE was about 2.72%, and the absolute error was 5.43 μm in the position range of 50-250 μm. The precision of DFAdM estimator was 4.85% and the absolute error was 9.71 μm. Frequency response analysis was used to evaluate the dynamics performance in open loop state, indicating 158° phase margin at the eigen frequency 19.26Hz. Moreover, a rig of self-sensing AMBs was setup with TMS320F2812, LEM HX-05, PM10CJS060 and micro-positioning platform. The precision of SS-DCE was about 2.53% referring to eddy current sensor HZ-891. SS-DCE-based rotor showed good stability, rapid convergence and acceptable overshot under pulse disturbances that applied through a direct knock on the truss by a rubber hammer. The proposed approach can provide a direct guidance for the active control of magnetic levitation, magnetic damper and other engineering fields. The influence of PWM duty-cycle and low SNR on magnetic bearings can be performed in the near future research works, thereby to enhance the application of magnetic bearings for modern agriculture. © 2020, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

The MSE achieved with the different channel estimators was also compared by varying the noise and interference power at the receiver. The proposed methodology relies on the characterisation of a massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel with a quasi-deterministic radio channel generator and a cyclic prefix orthogonal frequency division multiplexing link-level radio simulation. The fifthgeneration (5G) new radio (NR) frame structure was used to perform channel estimation and equalisation for operation frequencies below 6 GHz. Numerical results show that the MRC receiver achieves its maximum performance with the KF estimator, especially at low signal-to-noise ratio scenarios, while the RZF receiver achieves its maximum performance with the LS estimation even in high interference scenarios. © 2020 Institution of Engineering and Technology.

We first develop a more efficient GMM estimator and derive the efficiency bound under such restrictions. Then we construct an integrated Hausman-type test by summing up the squared differences between this more efficient estimator and the unrestricted estimator computed at different time points. Although less efficient under the null, the latter estimator is consistent under both the null and the alternative. The efficient GMM estimator can also be used to update an existing Bierens-type test and simplify the calculation of the asymptotic variance. Since the quadratic function puts more weight on large values, the Hausman-type test can have superior power than the Bierens-type test, which is based on a linear function of the differences. The simulation study shows that except for very small local window sizes, the Hausman-type test has good size and superior power. We finally apply these tests to studying the constant beta hypothesis using empirical data and find substantial evidence against this hypothesis. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

Secondly, the detection and outweighing outliers in state estimation process is addressed using projection statistics. It is shown that the proposed robust fusion UKF (RFUKF) increases the reliability of local bus frequency estimation against data loss and cyber-attacks affecting one of data sources due to the fusion method. More importantly, it is robust against observation outliers.

The DoS attacks are based on the time-sequence fashion and occur aperiodically in an unknown attack strategy, which can usually damage the control channels executed by an intelligent adversary. A novel event-triggered control scheme on the basis of the relative interagent state is developed under the DoS attacks, by designing a link-based estimator to estimate the relative interagent state between intermitted communication instead of the absolute state. Compared with most of the existing work on the design of the triggering condition related to the state measurement error, the proposed triggering condition is designed based on the control input signal from the view of privacy protection, which can avoid continuous sampling for every agent. Besides, the attack frequency and attack duration of DoS attacks are analyzed and the secure consensus is reachable provided that the attack frequency and attack duration satisfy some certain conditions under the proposed control algorithm. 'Zeno phenomenon' does not exhibit by proving that there exist different positive lower bounds corresponding to different link-based triggering conditions.

	abstract = {Fast real-time estimation of the grid frequency is essential for stable operation of renewable converter-based sources in future power systems. Therefore this paper presents a new phase-locked loop for the estimation of time-dependent frequencies in unbalanced power systems with harmonics. The proposed frequency estimation method consists of two signal processing steps: In the first step, a least mean square estimator reconstructs the fundamental sinusoidal signal from the measured three-phase grid voltage and splits it into positive, negative and zero sequence components. In the second step, the resulting first harmonic three-phase positive sequence is converted into the synchronous reference frame in the form of a phase-locked loop using a state feedback controller scheme to reconstruct the current grid frequency. Here the controller output is equivalent to the signal to be reconstructed. The feedback controller design is based on linear matrix inequalities where the requirements are explicitly considered. The capability of proposed state feedback phase-locked loop is demonstrated by full scaled electro magnetic transient simulations. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

	abstract = {Terahertz (THz) communication has emerged as a promising technology that efficiently alleviates the scarcity of the frequency resources, and is capable of providing Terabit-per-second (Tbps) data transmission. However, the hardware impairments, which are usually omitted in the low-rate systems, have a detrimental impact on the THz communication link. These hardware imperfections, including in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) imbalance, phase noise and nonlinearities of the power amplifier, can be approximately modelled as complex-Gaussian distortions at both the transmitter and the receiver. In this paper, the channel estimator and signal detector (CE/SD) design of the THz-band spatial modulation (THz-SM) system is investigated, where the counterparts for classical low-rate SM are no longer applicable. More specifically, a dual-stage maximum-likelihood (ML) channel estimator is proposed containing two phases of candidate acquirement and exhaustive search. Then a novel low-complexity mean-least-squares (MLS) channel estimator is developed by considering the hardware impairments in an averaging manner. Besides, the optimal detector for THz-SM is designed by taking hardware impairments into account. Simulation results validate that the proposed CE/SD design is capable of attaining reliable data transmission in THz-SM with hardware imperfections. © 1967-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The nonlinear V-I characteristic of solar cell, calls for the use of maximum power point tracking (MPPT) method in order to obtain optimum power from solar photovoltaic (PV) array. Conventional MPPT methods require one voltage and one current sensor. This paper proposes a novel single sensor-based MPPT technique for a PV array fed water pumping using a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) drive. As the use of encoders, is not preferred for submersible water pumping, this paper uses a sensorless speed and position estimation for speed control of PMSM. The estimation of rotor speed and position, is achieved through the estimation of stator flux from voltages and currents in stationary reference frame. As the conventional flux estimators suffer from the problems, such as saturation, dc drift, and distortion, this paper proposes a mix multi-resonant structure for flux estimation. A sensorless speed control decreases the cost and improves the reliability of the solar water pumping system. The energy extracted from the PV array, is used to drive the PMSM, which rotates the pump coupled to it. Suitability of the proposed system is demonstrated under varying insolation conditions through a prototype developed in the laboratory and utilizing a digital signal processor (dSPACE-1202) for controlling the SWP system.  © 2010-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {We discuss absolute calibration strategies for Phase I of the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA), which aims to measure the cosmological 21 cm signal from the Epoch of Reionization. HERA is a drift-scan array with a 10° wide field of view, meaning bright, well-characterized point-source transits are scarce. This, combined with HERA's redundant sampling of the uv plane and the modest angular resolution of the Phase I instrument, make traditional sky-based and self-calibration techniques difficult to implement with high dynamic range. Nonetheless, in this work, we demonstrate calibration for HERA using point-source catalogs and electromagnetic simulations of its primary beam. We show that unmodeled diffuse flux and instrumental contaminants can corrupt the gain solutions and present a gain-smoothing approach for mitigating their impact on the 21 cm power spectrum. We also demonstrate a hybrid sky and redundant calibration scheme and compare it to pure sky-based calibration, showing only a marginal improvement to the gain solutions at intermediate delay scales. Our work suggests that the HERA Phase I system can be well calibrated for a foreground avoidance power spectrum estimator by applying direction-independent gains with a small set of degrees of freedom across the frequency and time axes. © 2020.

	abstract = {Harmonic phasor estimation can be used both in power system protection and monitoring applications, such as islanding detection, high-impedance fault location, and harmonic state estimation. A key challenge for harmonic phasor estimation is that different harmonics have different harmonic frequency bandwidths. As a result, a harmonic phasor estimator (HPE) that can adapt to such variations is needed. Although the sinc interpolation function-based estimator (SIFE) has such ability, it has disadvantages that: 1) it needs numerous simulations to select the model parameter and 2) it cannot obtain zero-error results under nominal frequency condition. In this article, a novel HPE is proposed based on the frequency-domain sampling theorem, where the harmonic phasor is modeled based on several imaginary exponential functions. The proposed HPE is compared with the SIFE in frequency response, model parameter selection scheme, and simulation tests. The results show that the proposed HPE has the following three advantages: 1) it has an easier scheme for model parameter selection; 2) it has zero-error results under nominal frequency condition; and 3) it has higher accuracy under harmonic frequency deviation and harmonic modulation conditions. © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

The DFIG-dc system uses a diode bridge rectifier between the stator winding of DFIG and dc link. A reduced-power three-phase pulsewidth modulation converter is connected between the rotor winding of DFIG and dc link. Due to the diode commutation, the stator current and stator flux linkage are distorted with harmonics. To reduce the resulting torque ripple, the rotor currents need to track a pulsating reference signal to compensate the distortion of the stator flux. To improve the current tracking performance, MRF-based estimators are used to calculate the main harmonics in both the command value and actual value of the rotor current. Then, an MRF-based regulator is implemented to achieve an accurate tracking for the harmonics of the rotor current command. Both simulation and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in reducing the torque ripple. The robustness of the proposed algorithm against deviation of stator frequency is also supported by the simulation and experimental results. © 1986-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Phase-locked loops (PLLs) are widely popular in applications of grid synchronization for single-and three-phase utility power systems. However, these PLL-based methods are usually designed for constant frequency grids and these schemes only have fast dynamics and good accuracy in a small local region (i.e., phase-locked region). When applying these PLLs in the grids of more electric aircraft (MEA), in which the grid frequency varies in a wide range (360-800 Hz), both the dynamic response and the steady-state accuracy of PLLs reduce significantly. In light of this, this article presents a global convergence method to estimate the frequency, positive-and negative-sequence components of grid voltage in MEA power systems. By analyzing the relationship between the DC-offset component, the grid voltage, and their derivatives, a mathematic model with the unknown parameters, which are the DC-offset component and the grid frequency, is established. Accordingly, a global estimator is proposed to estimate the grid voltage parameters accurately. A Lyaponov-based argument ensures that the proposed estimator is global convergent and it has the capability to eliminate the DC offset effect completely. The experimental results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed estimator. © 1982-2012 IEEE.},

Most of the methods, which are already in use are calculated the noise power in the frequency domain by assuming perfect Carrier Frequency Offset(CFO). Hence, it leads to degradation of performance. In this paper, we proposed a time-domain periodic nulled subcarrier based method for estimating the noise power by assuming the existence of CFO. The noise power can be determined by calculating the second-order moment for the received periodic nulled subcarriers. The periodic repetition of nulled subcarriers is used for developing a computationally efficient algorithm. Compared to the existing noise power estimators, the proposed estimator reduces computational complexity significantly and also, this method doesn't require pilot carriers like other time-domain noise estimation methods. Hence, significant power saving can also be achieved through proposed noise power estimator. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Real-time power system monitoring and assessment leads to two major concern, prediction and evaluation of security and stability of power system. This assists in determination of in-time probable anomaly of the system. However, at the same time it requires real—time technological applications to measure network data at all strategic geographical locations. Synchrophasor technology based wide-area situational awareness ensures power system real—time monitoring and assessment. The chapter proposes real—time data driven Wide-area Situation Analyzer (WASA). WASA first detects an event in the system using synchrophasor measurements and then assesses its vulnerability posed to power network. The vulnerability is measured as severity in terms of first swing transient instability. Level of severity index is developed in terms of generator going out of step. The bus voltage trajectories going away with rest of the system due to generator(s) transient instability are considered. The proposed new approach is based on Center of Frequency (COF) formulated from limited Phasor Measurement Unit measurements. To check for an event existence in the system, a new decision based COF concept is defined. In order to determine the severity of the identified event, a new Predictor Indices (PI) is proposed using COF and PMU measurements. These predictor indices are used in assessment methodology, based on Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) of decision estimators. Furthermore, comparative results of proposed wide-area situational analyzer with other machine learning algorithms are also shown. The proposed WASA is instigated on IEEE New England 39 Bus system, successfully validating analyzer performance. The different type of events considered are generation outage, bus outage, load outage and line events. Additionally, if any bus outage occurs due to line faults then it is considered as single severity. The results reflects the efficacy of the proposed analyzer in event detection and its assessment efficiently and effectively with very less computational burden. The ability of the proposed analyzer to identify events quickly and correctly makes it appropriate for real—time applications. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

Prior to this, the signal is preprocessed using the Sliding Goertzel Filter (SGF) that mitigates the impact of undesirable features such as harmonics, noise, etc. from the signal. The two frequency estimators, with and without SGF, then work in parallel to form the hybrid estimator and named as ZCPk − HFE.

	abstract = {The control problem in wave energy continues to remain an open question. This is mainly attributed to the difficulties associated with developing effective, yet economically viable, wave energy-harnessing control strategies, such as resource irregularity, the multidisciplinary nature of the system, and dynamic model uncertainties and ambiguities. Herein, a maximum energy-capturing approach for heaving wave energy converters (WECs) using an estimator-based finite control set model predictive control (FCS-MPC) is proposed. The proposed control strategy utilizes an elaborate nonlinear wave-to-wire model of a heaving WEC. The FCS-MPC is formulated such that a control command trajectory is not required; instead, it searches for the optimum control law - in the form of switching functions - that maximizes the WEC converted electrical energy while imposing soft constraints on the states of the power take-off (PTO) mechanism. Current transducers are deployed to measure the PTO three-phase currents and both mechanical and electrical variables required by the FCS-MPC strategy are estimated using an electrical-based extended Kalman filter (E-EKF). Simulations were performed to assess the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy. Results presented herein clearly show that the proposed referenceless FCS-MPC managed to produce 10%-23% more energy compared with benchmark resistive loading-based techniques with both fixed and variable wave frequency capabilities while utilizing 18%-45% less PTO resources. © 2013 IEEE.},

We demonstrate that the proposed OFDM autoencoder system can be generalized to work under various channel environments, different throughputs, while outperforming the traditional OFDM counterparts, especially when working at high throughputs. In addition, since OFDM systems require accurate channel estimations to function properly, this treatise also proposes a new channel estimation algorithm for OFDM systems that combine the power of deep learning (DL) with the philosophy of super-resolution reconstruction, which uses dense convolutional neural networks (Dense-Nets) to reconstruct low-resolution pilot information images into high-resolution full-channel impulse responses (CIRs). The Dense-Net structure has the characteristics of dense connections and feature multiplexing. The simulation results show that under slow fading, the proposed channel estimator (CE) can estimate the CIRs perfectly. Under fast fading, the proposed CE outperforms the existing learning-based algorithms with fewer neural network parameters. Therefore, the proposed novel autoencoder scheme and the powerful CE are potentially attractive approaches for the Internet of Vessels (IoV). © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Free space optical communication (FSO) is widely deployed to transmit high data rates for rapid communication traffic increase. Asymmetrically clipped optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (ACO-OFDM) modulation is a very efficient FSO communication technique in terms of transmitted optical power. However, its performance is limited by atmospheric turbulence. When the channel includes strong turbulence or is non-deterministic, the bit error rate (BER) increases. To reach optimal performance, the ACO-OFDM decoder needs to know accurate channel state information (CSI). We propose novel detection using different deep learning (DL) algorithms. Our DL models are compared with minimum mean square error (MMSE) detection methods in different turbulent channels and improve performance especially for non-stationary and non-deterministic channels. Our models yield performance very close to that of the MMSE estimator when the channel is characterized by weak or strong turbulence and is stationary. However, when the channel is non-stationary and variable, our DL model succeeds in improving the performance of the system and decreasing the signal to noise ratio (SNR) by more than 8 dB compared to that of the MMSE estimator, and it succeeds in recovering the received data without needing to know accurate CSI. Our DL decoders also show notable speed and energy efficiency improvement. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Many critical electric grid operations rely on accurate grid frequency measurements. Unfortunately, the measurement accuracy can be easily undermined by power system transient faults. During a power system transient fault, the power grid voltages and currents are usually highly distorted by high-frequency components. What is worse, the power grid signals could have discontinuity during some system transient faults such as phase angle jump, and the discontinuity could result in large measurement errors to state-of-the-art grid measurement algorithms. In this study, a fault-tolerant grid frequency measurement algorithm during transients is proposed. The new algorithm consists of two stages. The first stage is a transient detector, and it can detect the occurrence of system transient faults instantaneously. The second stage is the intelligent frequency estimator, and it will adapt its measurements according to the transient detector. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated under different steady-state and transient conditions. Both dependability and security of the fault-tolerant algorithm are assessed by using PSCAD simulation data and IEEE Standard test data. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2020.},

	abstract = {In order to reduce their cost, offshore wind turbines (OWTs) must have a powerful generator and a minimum overall weight. This has the consequence of making the OWT structure sensitive to dynamic excitations even at low frequencies. Indeed, modern multi-megawatt OWTs are composed of slender flexible and lightly damped components. The excessive vibrations of the OWT structure can impact the wind energy conversion to electricity, decrease the fatigue lifetime and even result in a total collapse of the structure when exposed to harsh environmental conditions. It is therefore important to reduce the unwanted vibrations of an OWT by implementing an appropriate control device that enhances its structural safety. Motivated by the potential of the structural control methods in suppressing OWTs vibration, this paper proposes the design of a controlled active tuned mass damper (ATMD) system to reduce the nacelle/tower out-of-plane vibration of a monopile-supported 10 MW DTU OWT subjected to combined wave and wind loads. Compared to previous works, the main originality of this paper is the inclusion of a state estimator, Linear Quadratic (LQ) observer, within an optimal control schema. The state observer aims to drastically reduce the number of required system states. Indeed, as some measurements are practically impossible, all system states cannot be obtained. In this study, a fully coupled multi-degree of freedom (MDOF) analytical model of a monopile-supported OWT developed in [4] is used for this purpose. The optimal control schema makes use of the robust LQR feedback controller to establish the ATMD actuator control force. The developed active control schema proved to efficiently reduce the nacelle/tower vibration. Copyright © 2021 by ASME},

	abstract = {The watermarking technique is an active subject in current research used as a solution for copyright protection in multimedia documents. In this paper, we propose the first hardware invisible robust video watermarking application based on motion estimation. Since the designers of this application face many challenges, two types of architecture are performed: static and dynamic/partial reconfigurable architecture. The proposed architecture is adapted to HEVC encoded video. Two protection techniques are linked up: the digital watermarking to insert a watermark in the video, and the scrambling technique for overall video protection. The watermark embedding is treated in the horizontal and vertical components of even motion vectors. Eventually, the entire vectors are scrambled. The used watermark is a binary sequence where only one bit is inserted into the horizontal and the vertical components of motion vectors. The recommended architecture applies for slow and fast video sequence, where we use a motion estimator reconfigured according to the macro-block video movement. We also utilize a pipeline structure and a clock gating module to increase computing power and reduce power consumption. Experimental results show that the suggested static and dynamic/partial reconfigurable architecture guarantees material efficiency and superior performance in terms of frequency and power consumption.  © 2020 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

	abstract = {A frequency analysis of the occurrence of extreme peak electricity demand during the non-winter period using South African data for the period 2007–2013 is discussed in this paper. It is during the non-winter period when Eskom, South Africa’s power utility company usually carries out its maintenance of power plants. Extreme peak loads together with high unplanned and planned outages usually cause disruptions to the power plants’ maintenance programmes during this period. A detailed analysis of peak electricity demand is useful to maintain the stability of the power grid. If not properly managed this may result in negative economic impacts as electricity is one of the major drivers of any economy. Initially the data is detrended using a time-varying threshold. A sufficiently high threshold is obtained by using bounded corrected extremal mixture models. We then decluster the exceedances and fit a peaks-over-threshold model to cluster maxima. Empirical results show that demand of electricity significantly increases as a result of heat which builds up with consecutive days of extreme high temperatures. The main contribution of this paper is in the application of extreme value theory models in assessing the frequency of occurrence of extreme peak loads to assist power utilities in the planning of maintenance of generating units. The other contribution is in the development of a modelling framework which shows that as temperature converges to its upper bound, the marginal increase of electricity demand also converges. Most of the cluster maxima are experienced during the months October, November and February, suggesting that these may not be good months for scheduling maintenance of generating plants during the non-winter period in South Africa. This modelling approach may help system operators in scheduling and dispatching of electricity during the heatwave period. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {A new line of research on communications and signals design for Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) has recently emerged in the communication literature. Promising signal strategies to maximize the power transfer efficiency of WPT rely on (energy) beamforming, waveform, modulation and transmit diversity, and a combination thereof. To a great extent, the study of those strategies has so far been limited to theoretical performance analysis. In this paper, we study the real over-the-air performance of all the aforementioned signal strategies for WPT. To that end, we have designed, prototyped and experimented an innovative radiative WPT architecture based on Software-Defined Radio (SDR) that can operate in open-loop and closed-loop (with channel acquisition at the transmitter) modes. The prototype consists of three important blocks, namely the channel estimator, the signal generator, and the energy harvester. The experiments have been conducted in a variety of deployments, including frequency flat and frequency selective channels, under static and mobility conditions. Experiments highlight that a channel-adaptive WPT architecture based on joint beamforming and waveform design offers significant performance improvements in harvested DC power over conventional single-antenna/multi-antenna continuous wave systems. The experimental results fully validate the observations predicted from the theoretical signal designs and confirm the crucial and beneficial role played by the energy harvester nonlinearity. © 2002-2012 IEEE.},

In this paper, we analyze user equipment-aided calibration mechanism to estimate the amplitude scaling and phase drift at each radio-frequency chain connected to the BS array. Assuming a uniform linear array at the BS and Ricean fading, we obtain the estimation parameters with moment-based (amplitude, phase) and maximum-likelihood (phase-only) estimation techniques. In stark contrast to previous works, we mathematically articulate the equivalence of the two approaches for phase estimation. Furthermore, we rigorously derive a Cramér-Rao lower bound to characterize the accuracy of the two estimators. Via numerical simulations, we evaluate the estimator performance with varying dominant line-of-sight powers, dominant angles-of-arrival, and signal-to-noise ratios. © 2020 IEEE.},

To meet the requirements above, a novel iterative observer based method for harmonic state estimation is proposed. This method guarantees the stability of the harmonic estimation observer when output time delays are considered in the power distribution network.Meanwhile, signals with different frequencies can be estimated iteratively. System harmonics are regarded as the unknown exogenous disturbance, and each harmonic at multiple measurements is extracted and estimated iteratively. To guarantee the overall estimator stability, multiple transmission time delay is addressed in the system modelling for the design of observer gain. The proposed method achieves high estimation accuracy from multiple measurements while maintaining a low computation commitment. Comparing with traditional harmonic state estimation methods, the iterative observer is capable of estimating the unexpected harmonics. The IEEE 13-bus power distribution system built in the real-time digital simulator demonstrates the validity of the proposed method. © 2020 The Authors.},

Frequency synchronization is an important problem in power systems as frequency deviation can lead to degraded power quality, tripping of generators, etc. We present a load-estimator-based consensus algorithm that achieves practical frequency synchronization in the presence of unknown time-varying power demand. It is shown that the synchronization error can be made arbitrarily small by tuning a controller parameter.

	abstract = {Channel estimation is a challenging and timely issue for the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standardized low power wide-area network technology named narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT). Channel estimation is crucial to achieve extended radio coverage, energy efficiency, coherent detection, and channel equalization for signal repetition dominated NB-IoT uplink transmission. The NB-IoT inherits simplified baseband radio frequency processing, physical channels, reference signal structure, and numerology from existing Long Term Evolution (LTE) systems to save power and costs. Thus, channel estimation methods extensively employed in LTE systems may not be applied to the NB-IoT uplink systems. In this paper, efficient discrete cosine transform type-I (DCT-I)-based transform-domain channel estimation approaches are proposed by modifying the original definition of DCT-I. The proposed methods can mitigate the problems experienced in the discrete Fourier transform (DFT)-based channel estimation, such as signal aliasing error, and border effect. The proposed approaches improve channel estimation precision by reducing signal distortion from the high-frequency region in the time-domain when non-sample-spaced path delays exist in multipath fading channels. Signal aliasing error experienced from the virtual subcarriers is also minimized with the anticipated schemes. The proposed methods are applied on simple least squares (LS) estimates in time-domain to eliminate estimation noise. The viability of the proposed estimators is verified as compared to the conventional LS, DFT-based de-noising LS, and standard DCT-I based methods through extensive numerical simulations. Based on the numerical simulations, the proposed estimators show better mean square error and bit error rate performances than their competitors in extremely low coverage conditions.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a Fuzzy Model Predictive Control (FMPC) model as a small signal stability control of a power generation system. Load fluctuations are one of the problems with small signal stability. But in reality, load fluctuations form a dynamic pattern of time series so that it can be predicted. DSARIMA time series models meet predictive criteria. Predicted results are used as load cluster models. Load clustering aims to optimize the operation of the generating system criteria. The FMPC method proposed in this study is the development of the Fuzzy Takagi-Sugeno model. Fuzzy T-S consists of a state estimator (Fuzzy State Estimator) approach to identify each load change and identify the optimal control model (FMPC) for each control input state. The development of Fuzzy T-S in fuzzy state estimators and FMPC functions as multiple soft-switching for each load condition. Through this method, FMPC is able to predict electrical power near real load conditions. FMPC has a performance that can guarantee all load conditions with better frequency and voltage stability than conventional optimal control methods. © School of Engineering, Taylor’s University},

	abstract = {In this paper, a method to generate large amounts of Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) currents with harmonics simulating the actual EAF operation characteristics to be used with deep learning (DL) applications of harmonic estimation is investigated. For this purpose, the behavior of the EAF current harmonics is examined in statistical terms using the field data collected at a transformer substation supplying an EAF plant. Then, a significantly larger amount of EAF current data is generated using the statistics mimicking the real EAF behavior to train the DL-based harmonic estimator. The outcomes of the research work presented in this paper are two-fold: (i) DL-based method is used to extract phase and amplitude information of the harmonics of the EAF currents using the waveform directly, without computing any time- or frequency-domain features during the estimation process, which helps reduce the processing time , (ii) EAF current data with realistic amounts of time-varying harmonics based on the statistics obtained from a tap-to-tap time of the EAF currents is generated, hence a detailed statistical analysis of the EAF current spectrum is achieved. The method proposed can be used to eliminate the uncharacteristic harmonics of the EAF currents, since it can provide fast and accurate phase and amplitude estimates of the harmonics, serving the need for active power filters in the electricity system. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Hydropower units undertake tasks such as peak shaving, frequency modulation, and providing accident reserves in the power system. With the increasing capacity and structural complexity of power systems, hydropower units have become more important. Hydraulic-turbine-governing systems (HTGSs) need to have higher control performance and automation levels to meet the higher regulatory requirements of the power system. To achieve high-quality control, we proposed a new finite-time, fault-tolerant control method for HTGSs with an actuator fault. First, a fractional-order model for HTGSs with uncertainty, external disturbance, and an actuator fault was introduced. Second, a fault estimator that could quickly track the fault signal for an actuator fault was proposed. Then, based on the fractional-order finite-time stability theorem, a finiteâtime, fault-tolerant controller was proposed for the stabilization of an HTGS. Furthermore, a controller was developed as a fractional differential form combined with a smooth bounded arctangent function to effectively suppress jitters and uncertainties. Finally, numerical experimental results verified the validity and robustness of the proposed scheme. © 2020 MDPI AG. All rights reserved.},

However, extracting the characteristic of the fault can be difficult at the presence of additional interferences. Under this constraint, the present article suggests a new technique for inter-Turn stator winding fault diagnosis. The detection method is mainly based on calculating the stator current Power Spectral Density. Primary, the model of Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor under faulty operating condition is established by considering some parameters assigned to fault severity and fault location. Afterward, two Power Spectral Density methods have been compared in terms of their frequency resolution, and their effect in fault spectral components determination. These methods are namely the Welch and Autoregressive model based Burg. The results obtained confirm the preponderance of the Welch method over the Burg estimator in fault characteristics extraction for big record data. © 2020 IEEE.},

However, those systems have oversize problem and requires high sampling rate and high time synchronization rate to maintain high estimation accuracy. To address this challenge, this paper proposed a received signal strength indicator (RSSI) based PD localization method. This paper researches on the feasibility and accuracy of PD direction of arrival (DoA) using power of UHF RSSI signal. After achieving the UHF antenna power pattern in the experiment, the paper proposes a method using maximum likelihood estimator to handle PD direction of arrival estimation and obtain the orientation results. We conduct a field test and the experiment results show the average error of direction of arrival is less than 6°.

This contribution presents a state-of-the-art test rig in the multi-megawatt regime equipped with an innovative hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) system which enables ground-based testing of full scale wind turbines. The proposed system consists of a state estimator, an internal wind turbine model comprising an aeroelastic rotor model for reference generation as well as control loops for setpoint tracking and active drivetrain damping purposes. The introduced HiL system is validated experimentally in detail at a test rig with a mounted state-of-the art 3 MW full scale wind turbine. Experiments prove the system's ability to emulate the nacelles drivetrain dynamics on ground-level while guaranteeing stable operation over the full wind speed range and in demanding instationary design load cases such as gust events. Experimental results show wind turbine related frequency shares originated in the dynamics of the physically not present rotor, e.g. per-revolution frequencies, tower shadow as well as the first torsional drivetrain eigenfrequency are induced.

	abstract = {Autonomous, self-governing micro energy networks are a smart energy solution that satisfy the energy needs of isolated communities. Such smart micro networks usually comprise of several distributed semi-controllable power resources, storages and loads. Usually, the power generation sources draw their energy from renewable energy resources. Power electronics converters suitably condition the power to be transmitted and utilized. A sensory, control and communication layer ensures the integration of several network components to achieve stable network operation. Distributed power-sharing methods function at local processing and decision-making nodes across the energy network. The complete control scheme is a hierarchical structure divided into four control levels. Faults and latencies experienced at the communication network layer adversely affect the performance of the control scheme. This paper proposes a new and improved hierarchical, multi-agents-based control strategy for efficient power-sharing, voltage and frequency regulation between nodes during communication link latencies. A novel distributed averaging estimator is proposed to estimate power injected in the system at various nodes and thereby mitigate the effect of relayed information delays. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is established comprehensively through mathematical modeling, analytical proofs, discrete-time small signal stability analysis, and MATLAB case study simulations. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The present paper aims to investigate and analyze the performance of a point-to-point optical network under a free-space optical (FSO) communication system. Free-space optical communication is a sophisticated technique that has been employed as a channel model of optical wireless communication to transfer large amounts of data at high speeds. However, two important issues, that could affect the source of the FSO link, have been added. The first one is related to chromatic dispersion which is attributed to the chirping phenomenon of the optical signal; the second issue concerns the secondary jamming power that can be generated by some Radio Frequencies from base stations. It is important to note that the effects of atmospheric turbulence, misalignment fading, and atmospheric attenuation as well as geometric losses were also taken into account. The purpose of this research work is to overcome these effects, in order to increase the data transmission rate from 1.25 to 50 Gbps in the proposed system. Consequently, a very efficient solution is suggested to correct these problems and to make the FSO link more reliable using the Beta-Average Recursive Estimator. In addition, the numerical results obtained are presented for the purpose of validating our proposal through the evaluation of the performance of a transmission link in terms of the bit error rate and Q-factor. In the end, the resulting conclusions are listed, explained and discussed. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {The proposed work concentrates on the integration of an 8-GHz voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) and a frequency tripler for 24-GHz local oscillator generation. By stacking the VCO and the tripler with a current-reused topology, the power consumption of this integration can be saved. The proposed circuit with a total chip area of 0.7 mm ×0.8 mm is implemented in a 0.18 μm CMOS process. As the tuning voltage increases from 0 to 2 V, the measured frequency tuning range (FTR) of the VCO is from 7.06 to 8.33 GHz. The final resulting output frequency from the tripler ranges from 21.18 to 24.98 GHz (16.5% FTR). The core circuit totally consumes 5 mA from a 1.8-V supply voltage. The measured phase noises at the VCO and frequency tripler outputs are − 113.76 and − 105.1 dBc/Hz at 1-MHz offset frequency, respectively, when Vtune is 0 V. The best evaluated figure of merit with tuning is − 187.2 dBc/Hz (decibels relative to carrier). Closed form equations allow for a performance driven design for both PLL and estimator. By using a variable sample frequency controlled by the PLL, the Kalman filter is always operated around its center frequency, which is the rated grid frequency. The new topology is compared to other published single-phase PLL designs and its operation is verified by both simulations and experiments. This integration of a VCO and a frequency tripler exhibits a high potential for the use in low-power 24-GHz phase-locked loops. The PLL designed using dual mode logic technique exhibits excellent performance even under severely distorted utility grid voltage conditions. This robustness makes it very suitable for use in systems connected to grids having an important share of non-linear loads. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {In positioning research based on the orthogonal frequency division multiplex (OFDM) system, the observed time difference of arrival positioning method is a widely studied direction. The terminal measures the reference signal sent by the base station to calculate the time of arrival (TOA). Using TOA information, the location of the terminal can be identified. So the accuracy of the positioning is highly dependent on the results of the TOA measurements. Terminals often have difficulty measuring accurate TOA due to multipath channels and occlusion of obstacles. This study proposes two clustering-based TOA estimation methods. The cluster-based Max-peak estimator is used to solve the problem that the energy of the first-path is not the strongest in the case of multipath. Moreover, a cluster-based adaptive threshold estimator is used to estimate TOA when the power of the direct path is low. The joint estimator of the two methods is designed to improve estimation accuracy. The proposed method is tested in the OFDM localisation environment, and the results demonstrate that the proposed method has better performance than the conventional way. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2020.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose two groups of recursive codes, namely the Hadamard recursive carrier interferometry (HRCI) codes and diagonal recursive carrier interferometry (DRCI) codes, to simultaneously reduce the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) and suppress the phase noises and residual carrier frequency offset (RCFO) for high-speed orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. We exploit the recursion property of the Hadamard and diagonal matrices to constitute the proposed HRCI code and DRCI code using the carrier interferometry (CI) code, and present the system model in details to spread OFDM symbols in the frequency domain. Then, we prove that both HRCI and DRCI generation matrices keep their invertibility during the recursions. As a direct result of the new code design, the phase intervals are enlarged and the signals are shifted in the time domain, thus both the PAPR and the phase noises are reduced, and the RCFO can be mitigated. Moreover, the enlarged phase intervals enable the transceiver blocks including the channel estimator, which estimate the phase noise based on the received signals, to improve the performance. Furthermore, we present the expressions for the HRCI and DRCI embedded transmitted and received signals, and derive the analytical signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) expressions for bit error rate (BER) performance analysis. Then, we analyze the effects of presented codes on the phase differences and provide the computational complexity analysis. Numerical simulations verify the effectiveness of our theoretical analysis of SINR. Additionally, under different parameter settings, which consider the working conditions of practical systems, we demonstrate that the presented robust HRCI and DRCI coded OFDM systems can suppress the PAPR satisfactorily and better BER performances can be achieved by the recursive CI-aided spread OFDM systems with phase noise rejection and RCFO compensation when compared with counterpart systems. © 1967-2012 IEEE.},

In the proposed method, the voltage signal at one of the HVDC stations is stepped down via a resistive-capacitive voltage divider (RCVD) and passed through an anti-aliasing low-pass active filter (LPAF). Then, the frequency spectrum is obtained by applying the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) to the postfault voltage signal. The input pattern for presenting to the fault-location estimator is formed based on the most useful features selected from the extracted harmonic spectrum. In this paper, the regression relief (RReliefF) algorithm is utilized for automatic feature selection. Also, the random forest (RF) algorithm is used to build the fault-location estimator founded on a group of regression decision trees. The method is applied for fault locating in a 700-km-long HVDC line considering various fault locations, short-circuit resistances, prefault currents, and fault types. The obtained overall average of percentage errors in the fault-location estimate for 1800 different unseen test cases is 0.188%, which confirms the accurate and good generalization performance of the presented method. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Full-duplex (FD) communication at millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequencies suffers from a strong self-interference (SI) signal, which can only be partially canceled using conventional RF cancelation techniques. This is because current digital SI cancellation techniques, designed for microwave frequencies, ignore the rapid phase noise (PN) variation at mmWave frequencies, which can lead to large estimation errors. In this work, we consider a multiple-input multiple-output mmWave FD communication system. We propose an extended Kalman filter-based estimation algorithm to track the rapid variation of PN at mmWave frequencies. We derive a lower bound for the estimation error of PN at mmWave and numerically show that the mean square error performance of the proposed estimator approaches the lower bound. We also simulate the bit error rate performance of the proposed system and show the effectiveness of a digital canceler, which uses the proposed estimator to estimate the SI channel. The results show that for a 2×2 FD system with 64−QAM modulation and PN variance of 10−4, the residual SI power can be reduced to − 25 dB and − 40 dB, respectively, for signal-to-interference ratio of 0 and 15 dB. © 2019, The Author(s).},

To control grid-connected converters, precise information of the grid voltage frequency and phase are required. Gradient estimators can be very useful in this regard. They are suitable to estimate the frequency and phase of the grid voltage signal. Various gradient estimators are already available in the literature e.g. regression-based techniques. However, most of them are designed by using the instantaneous estimation error as the cost-function. This amplifies the effect of noise in the estimated parameters. To overcome this issue, an integral cost-function is considered in this paper. The integral cost-function tries to minimize the estimation error over the integration window leading to reduce the effect of noise in the estimated frequency and phase. Moreover, the cost-function uses tunable forgetting factor to give more importance to recent data. The proposed gradient estimator assumes the grid frequency to be constant. However, in practice the frequency is variable with known nominal value. To overcome this problem, a frequency estimation block is coupled with the gradient estimator. The frequency estimation block uses the idea of phase-based frequency estimation. Comparative numerical simulation and experimental studies are performed to demonstrate the suitability of the proposed technique over three other advanced techniques from the literature. © 2013 IEEE.},

As a case for study, false data injection (FDI) attacks on wide-area Under-Frequency Load Shedding (UFLS) protection schemes are considered. Our analysis shows that attackers can drive the system out of stability by manipulating frequency measurements that are supplied to the control center by each local system. Then, we propose a detection strategy based on an unknown input estimator using Kalman filter, where frequencies as well as the power disturbance of system generators are estimated and compared with the received values. Then, a decision is made whether there is an attack or not based on the cumulative error residual. The effectiveness of the proposed approach in detecting FDI on wide-area UFLS protection schemes is confirmed through simulation using the IEEE 14 bus benchmark system. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper develops a new class of estimators for integrated volatility in the presence of market microstructure noise and jumps. These estimators are based on the simultaneous use of preaveraged modulated multi-power variation estimation and the threshold technique, which serve to remove microstructure noise and jumps respectively. We also prove the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators, including consistency and the associated central limit theorems. Monte Carlo simulations show that these estimators are robust to both microstructure noise and Lévy jumps and provide better performances than pre-averaged modulated multi-power variation (PMMV) estimation (Vetter, 2008). In the empirical applications, using the tick by tick high-frequency data from the Chinese stock market, we estimate continuous volatility, jump volatility and noise variance for SSE 50 component stocks during the stock market crash in 2015 based on our new estimators, and study the relationships among them. The main findings are summarized as follows: 1) noise volatility has significantly positive predictability for total volatility of underlying returns, however, such predictability holds mainly for continuous volatility rather than jump volatility; 2) continuous volatility, rather than jump volatility, has significantly positive predictability for noise volatility that exhibits strong dependence. The results imply that noise is not pure "noise", instead, it contains some useful information that helps predict volatility of the underlying asset price and such information merits further research. © 2019, Editorial Board of Journal of Systems Engineering Society of China.

Due to the sparsity of the covariance matrix of IoT/LTE signals, we reveal that the likelihood ratio test approximates to energy detection (ED) at low signal to noise ratio. However, the noise (power) uncertainty can degrade the performance of ED severely, especially when low-cost IoT devices are employed for spectrum sensing. To tackle this issue, we derive the relationship among noise power, total power, and autocorrelation coefficient of received signals, and propose an unbiased estimator of noise power without the knowledge of the presence/absence of IoT/LTE signals. We then design a new ED with multiple estimates of noise power from historical and current sensing data, and analyze its theoretical performance. Numerical results are provided to verify the theoretical results and demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed detector. It is shown that, by exploiting sufficient historical sensing data, the performance of the proposed ED can closely approach that of the ideal ED. © 2014 IEEE.},

A robust voltage controller is required in a droop-controlled inverter that operates connected to a grid or in island mode with other generators. In such modes of operation, the voltage source converter can experience large load-impedance variations depending on the number of parallel generators or the grid impedance value. Concerning the controller performance, the transient response is improved by selectively minimizing the output impedance of the system at the frequencies that typically contain the largest components of the output current. Complete harmonic control is achieved due to its zero output impedance at a set of design-selected frequencies. The proposed controller only measures the output voltage, and it contains a single-loop structure that uses all available bandwidth. In addition, a fast converter-current estimator provides protection against faults and inrush output currents. The design process only requires, as input parameters, the LC filter values, the sampling frequency, and a set of harmonics where load-current circulation is expected. © 1972-2012 IEEE.},

The synchrophasor-based event classification techniques face challenges like similar responses for different classes of events, i.e., inter-class similarity (ICS), applicability to limited classes of events, and moderate real-time performance for a large power system. In addition, the enhanced ICS effect of increased renewable penetration on events classification needs to be addressed. This paper proposes a kernel density estimation approach for accurate real-time classification of events in a power system with renewables using synchrophasor data. The proposed method uses a diffusion type kernel density estimator (DKDE) to characterize the shape of 3-D voltage and frequency distribution along time in terms of probability density functions (PDFs). That have distinct scale, shape, and orientation for different classes of events. Thereafter, a set of statistical features is derived from PDFs to train a multi-layered deep neural network for event classification. The proposed method is validated for renewables in IEEE-39 bus system and real transmission system of India grid using DIgSILENT/PowerFactory and also on a real phasor measurement unit data for India grid, where it showed better performance for ICS and renewable integration cases. © 2010-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems consist of a large number of antennas and radio frequency (RF) chains, which cause enormous circuit power consumption at the RF front ends. Since high-resolution analog-To-digital converters are the main contributor in the RF circuit power consumption, one-bit massive MIMO is considered as one of the potential solutions.The channel state information (CSI) acquisition in the presence of pilot contamination is a challenging task in such systems. In this paper, we present an iterative semi-blind-based channel estimation scheme for pilot contaminated one-bit multi-cell multi-user massive MIMO systems, which comprise of two stages: initialization and iteration. The initial channel estimate uses pilots in the initialization stage, which is further refined in the iteration stage with the help of both pilot and a few data symbols. We derive lower bounds on the uplink achievable rate with both perfect and imperfect CSI availability at the base station. Through simulations, we show that the proposed estimator achieves a considerable improvement in mean square error, bit-error-rate, power efficiency, and spectral efficiency from one-bit pilot-Aided estimators at the cost of a nominal increase in computational complexity. Moreover, the proposed scheme in one-bit system achieves almost the same spectral efficiency as that of a pilot-Aided estimator in an infinite-resolution-based massive MIMO system for lower values of signal-To-noise-ratio (SNR). © 2021 Georg Thieme Verlag.

	abstract = {This paper studies the phase and frequency estimation problem of single-phase grid voltage signal in the presence of DC offset and harmonics. For this purpose, a novel parameterized linear model of the grid voltage signal is considered where the unknown frequency of the grid is considered as the parameter. Based on the developed model, a linear observer (Luenberger type) is proposed. Then using Lyapunov stability theory, an estimator of the unknown grid frequency is developed. In order to deal with the grid harmonics, multiple parallel observers are then proposed. The proposed technique is inspired by other Luenberger observers already proposed in the literature. Those techniques use coordinate transformation that requires real-time matrix inverse calculation. The proposed technique avoids real-time matrix inversion by using a novel state-space model of the grid voltage signal. In comparison to similar other techniques available in the literature, no coordinate transformation is required. This significantly reduces the computational complexity w.r.t. similar other techniques. Comparative experimental results are provided with respect to two other recently proposed nonlinear techniques to show the dynamic performance improvement. Experimental results demonstrate the suitability of the proposed technique. © 2013 IEEE.},

Therefore, an improved Tr identification method and control strategy were presented. Firstly, based on flux estimator in pitch control system, the influences of motor parameters on flux were analyzed using Frequency Response Functions (FRF), which could derive the dominant parameter. Secondly, based on the Model Reference Adaptive System (MRAS), the initial value of identification was treated as the compensation term to weaken the effect of variable motor speeds and load torques, then the pitch control strategy with this improved MRAS-based identification for Tr in wind turbine system were developed.

First, a GSP representation is obtained by finding the graph filter that best approximates the known measurement function. The new GSP representation enables performing tractable operations over graphs, as well as gaining insights into the signal graph-frequency contents. Then, we formulate the signal recovery problem under the smoothness constraint and derive a regularized least-squares (LS) estimator, which is obtained by applying the inverse of the approximated graph filter on the nonlinear measurements. In the second part of this paper, we investigate the proposed recovery and representation approach for the special case of graph signals that are influenced by the differences between vertex values only. Difference-based graph signals arise, for example, when modeling power signals as a function of the voltages in electrical networks. We show that any difference-based graph signal corresponds to a filter that lacks the zero-order filter coefficient, and thus, these signals can be recovered up to a constant by the regularized LS estimator. In our simulations, we show that for the special case of state estimation in power systems the proposed GSP approach outperforms the state-of-the-art estimator in terms of total variation. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The use of low-resolution analog-to-digital converters can significantly reduce power consumption and hardware cost. However, their resulting severe nonlinear distortion makes achieving reliable data transmission challenging. For orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) transmission, the orthogonality among subcarriers is destroyed. This invalidates conventional OFDM receivers relying heavily on this orthogonality. In this paper, we move on to quantized OFDM (Q-OFDM) prototyping implementation based on our previous achievement in optimal Q-OFDM detection. First, we propose a novel Q-OFDM channel estimator by extending the generalized Turbo (GTurbo) framework formerly applied for optimal detection. Specifically, we integrate a type of robust linear OFDM channel estimator into the original GTurbo framework, and derive its corresponding extrinsic information to guarantee its convergence. We also propose feasible schemes for automatic gain control, noise power estimation, and synchronization. Combined with the proposed inference algorithms, we develop an efficient Q-OFDM receiver architecture. Furthermore, we construct a proof-of-concept prototyping system and conduct over-the-air (OTA) experiments to examine its feasibility and reliability. This is the first work that focuses on both algorithm design and system implementation in the field of low-resolution quantization communication. The results of the numerical simulation and OTA experiment demonstrate that reliable data transmission can be achieved. © 1972-2012 IEEE.},

The modified self-cancelling technology provides the best performance in respect of the CIR and the Bit-Error (BER) ratio only compared with the conventional technique. The adder module interference estimator also often needs data path units in this paper. Mostly as a result, a detailed explanation is still based on increasing the delay in capacity of the adder. The Ripple adductor and the output of the skip adder of each step depends on the previous carrier, but once it is returned to hold tree adders, it produces the transmission signals in O(log n) time and is regarded to have been the simplest and best VLSI output.

	abstract = {Channel estimation is crucial to achieving wide-area coverage for ultra-low-cost and low-power narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) devices that are in coverage extremities. Radio coverage can be extended by repeatedly transmitting the same signal over a protracted period. In repetition dominated NB-IoT systems, existing channel estimators extensively used in the orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system may be no longer applicable due to their considerable computational complexity and power consumption. In this paper, we propose narrowband demodulation reference signal (NDMRS)-assisted transform-domain low-complexity channel estimation algorithms named random sorting least squares (RS-LS), and de-noising LS (D-LS). Another sub-optimal estimator, stemming from the filtered channel estimates called linear minimum mean square error-approximation (LMMSE-A) is also studied. We first estimate initial channel response at pilot frequencies using the conventional LS method; and then, apply several additional operations in time-domain to suppress LS estimation error without exploiting extra frequency-band resources, and increasing significant computational complexity. Finally, channel estimates for the remaining OFDM symbols within an NB-IoT subframe are obtained by employing the time dimensional linear interpolation. Through several simulation examples, the viability of the proposed estimators is verified in comparison with the conventional LS, denoise, and optimal LMMSE estimators in terms of channel mean square error (MSE), block error rate (BLER), and throughput against signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for Long Term Evolution (LTE)-based uplink NB-IoT systems. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {To solve the problem of requiring response transmissibility functions corresponding to multiple load conditions, power spectral density transmissibility (PSDT) was constructed by introducing the transferring output to obtain modal properties of bridge structures under ambient excitations. Further, the unique feature of PSDT approaching the system poles was revealed by a limit theorem. Based on this feature, the rationale for a PSDT-driven peak-picking method was elucidated. In addition, to overcome the shortcoming of the inability to identify the damping ratio involved in conventional transmissibility-based operational modal analysis (TOMA), PSDT was combined with a least-squares complex frequency-domain estimator to identify the modal variables by fitting a parametric model. Further, a stabilization diagram was constructed to separate the stable system poles. A ten-story plane frame subjected to harmonic excitation was adopted to investigate the robustness of the PSDT method, as well as the conventional frequency-domain approaches, to the nature of excitations. Finally, ambient vibration test data from a pedestrian bridge was employed to study the applicability of PSDT-based strategies to real bridges. The extracted results from the PSDT methods were compared with those identified by conventional TOMA and stochastic subspace identification (SSI). The results show that PSDTs with various transferring outputs are equal to the ratio of mode shapes. In contrast to conventional frequency-domain OMA approaches, PSDT is less sensitive to harmonic excitation and can thus reduce the risk of identifying the fault modes caused by harmonic excitation. Compared with the TOMA method, PSDT can identify the damping ratio of the footbridge and produce clear peaks as well as a stabilization diagram. Moreover, the obtained results using PSDT agree well with those using SSI, which validates the capability of PSDT to capture the modal parameters of real bridges under a single operational loading condition. © 2019, Editorial Department of China Journal of Highway and Transport.

The operation of the converter implies the presence of a second order frequency component in the dc link voltage, and the increment in the conventional voltage controller bandwidth causes total harmonic distortion of the output current to be deteriorated due to this component. The proposed method is based on the design of a lead compensator and a ripple voltage estimator. The former is used to attenuate the low order harmonic content and to increase the bandwidth, the latter is intended to reduce the ripple component in the feedback loop of the dc link voltage controller. The procedure to obtain the lead compensator is discussed and fully validated via simulation results, as well as the ripple estimator which is derived from the power balance on the dc link, for different sudden changes of the solar irradiance. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the constant-envelope orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (CE-OFDM) has been considered as a candidate waveform in broadband satellite systems as it has a 0-dB peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). However, the carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimation scheme for CE-OFDM broadband satellite systems directly affects system performance. In this paper, we analyze the network architecture and the propagation environment of CE-OFDM broadband satellite systems, and we propose a data-aided CFO estimation strategy based on the frequency domain pilot symbols. The Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) of our CFO estimator is given by mathematical analysis, and the effect of the number of pilot symbols on the estimation performance is analyzed. The pilot symbol-based CFO estimator is composed of a phase demodulator and a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) module, and it can obtain a large estimation range under a small pilot overhead. The simulation results show that the CE-OFDM broadband satellite systems can achieve a good bit error rate (BER) performance by using the proposed strategy to estimate and compensate the CFO. © 2019 by the authors.},

The tested estimators are implemented according to the original proposal and the study is focused on the analysis of the synchronous reference frame PLL (SRF), the flexible SRF PLL and the dual second-order generalized integrator frequency locked loop (DSOGI-FLL). When implemented in microgrids, the frequency estimator is responsible for the generation of a suitable reference for VSC controllers, specifically, for the Park transformation in the dq reference control. Also, this estimator returns the measured frequency at the point of common coupling, which is necessary for hierarchical controllers.

Systems for generating electrical energy of variable frequency and a constant value of the generated voltage are already available on board the medium-haul aircraft. In this case, devices, which ensure frequency stabilization, are excluded from the system. Aircrafts such as the Boeing-787, A-380 and the new Russian aircraft MC-21 may be cited as examples. The article presents a starter-generator system for the mid-flight engine of the aircraft based on the synchronous motor with permanent magnets (PMSM) and semiconductor converter. The system is built using the algorithm of the adaptive estimator based on the flux linkage, by which it is possible to refuse from the speed sensor and position sensor rotor, which reduces mass and dimensions and reduces the number of information lines of the system.

	abstract = {The estimation of flux as the integral of voltage presents challenges due to known integrator issues such as drift and saturation, while requiring high-pass filters to suppress DC offsets and low-frequency harmonics. High-pass filters in applications such as motor control need to be adaptive, in order to allow operation in an extended frequency range. The estimated fluxes are commonly fed to a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL), to calculate the voltage/flux angle and frequency. Common PLLs for three-phase systems operate on the basis of balanced input signals. Their estimates deteriorate in the existence of imbalance, which can affect the response of the controllers acting based on them. This paper presents an adaptive positive-sequence flux estimator based on Second-Order Generalized Integrators (SOGIs). The balanced fluxes generated by the estimator can be used for synchronization with an imbalanced grid or for sensorless control of a motor over an imbalanced cable. Simulation results are included to illustrate the method's application to an imbalanced grid and its response to transient conditions. Experimental results using a commercial motor drive running a permanent magnet motor (PMM) connected to the drive via a long cable are presented to compare the method with the conventional alternative. A representative example of instability and loss of control occurring when using conventional integrators for sensorless control of a PMM over a flat armoured cable is included to illustrate the advantage offered by the proposed approach. © 2019 EPE Association.},

	abstract = {The application of time division duplex (TDD) operation in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems make the resources required for channel estimation independent of the number of antennas at the base station (BS), while its dependence on the number of users causes pilot contamination. The more pilot slots available in superimposed pilot (SIP) arrangement compared to the conventional time-multiplexed pilot (TMP) arrangement allows higher amount of generatable orthogonal pilots; therefore, SIP arrangement have recently gained significant attentions for pilot decontamination. An SIP based method, exploiting first-order statistics of the received signals, is proposed for the estimation of frequency selective sparse massive-MIMO channels. A multi-cell radio communication scenario is considered, where the data and SIP associated to the users within a certain cell are taken non-orthogonal and orthogonal, respectively. An iterative receiver algorithm is proposed, which eliminates the contribution of information sequences from the received signals prior to estimating the channels and then eliminates the contribution of pilots from the received signal prior to decoding the users' information sequences. The proposed work focuses on the propagation scenarios which lead to a sparse structured channel impulse response (CIR); while the theory of compressed sensing (CS) is adopted for the reconstruction of CIR. Mathematical expressions to study the behaviour of signal to noise and interference ratio (SINR), observed at different stages of the receiver, are derived. A thorough analysis on the effect of training-to-information power ratio (TIR), number of BS antennas, and channels' sparsity level on bit error rate (BER), SINR, user sum-rate, normalized channel mean square error (NCMSE) performance of the proposed method is conducted. A performance comparison of the proposed method with notable methods from the classes of TMP and SIP arrangements is conducted. In a scenario, when the BSs antennas are taken as 128, channel sparsity set at 4/14, and studied after 5 iterations, the proposed SIP based method outperforms the existing TMP based method for the values of TIR in the range [0.112, 0.419]; while the optimal value of TIR is observed as 0.24. © 2019 IEEE.},

Reviewed methods either do not allow for intuitive trade-off tuning between the objectives of synchronous state restoration, local reference tracking, and disturbance rejection, or do not consider all of these objectives. In this paper, we address all of these objectives for voltage restoration in droop-controlled inverter-based islanded micro-grids. By using distributed model predictive control (DMPC) in series with an unscented Kalman Filter (UKF), we design a secondary voltage controller to restore the voltage to the reference in finite time. The DMPC solves a reference tracking problem while rejecting reactive power disturbances in a noisy system. The method we present accounts for non-zero mean disturbances by design of a random-walk estimator. We validate the method's ability to restore the voltage in finite time via modeling a multi-node microgrid in Simulink. © 2019 IEEE.},

The performance of optimized Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) in pole placement is compared with Kalman estimator. Optimization algorithms such as Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization are used to optimize positive definite matrices Q and R, weighting matrices of a LQR controller. Kalman estimator estimates the states of the system by measuring only one output signal which in this paper is mentioned as the change in frequency for the system considered. The comparison is made on the basis of the mean of the variances of the output, using the mentioned approaches.

	abstract = {This paper presents a Nonlinear Model Predictive Controller (NMPC) designed to provide optimal control input for maximum turbine power generation in an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) Waste Heat Recovery (WHR) system. While the literature is rich in ORC-WHR system modeling and control approaches in simulation environments, the fundamental dynamic analysis, system aging, thermal inertia, and experimental implementation of power optimization based optimal ORC-WHR control are still lacking. These factors are key to fully understanding and controlling the dynamic behavior of the system and are the main focus of this study. In contrast to prior literature, this work experimentally evaluates the nonlinear dynamics of the ORC system to comprehensively understand the controller design requirements. A power optimization-based Nonlinear Model Predictive Controller (NMPC) is derived utilizing an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) as a state estimator. Simulation results indicate that optimal turbine power generation is obtained with minimal working fluid superheat for the system under study. Consequently, a superheat-tracking controller is designed, and the performance of the controller is simulated over step inputs. The designed controller is then experimentally validated on an ORC test rig with a 13L Heavy Duty Diesel Engine (HDDE). During experimental evaluation of the controller, it was discovered that the control-oriented model is susceptible to system aging effects and therefore, the model was calibrated online to match the behavior of the aged system. Moreover, evaporator thermal inertia was found to play a vital role attenuating the fluctuating frequency components of the exhaust conditions. The tuned controller provided satisfactory control response for transient engine conditions and maintained the working fluid temperature within acceptable limits. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

As utilization of various network resources over time often exhibits broad and skewed distribution, estimating quantiles of metrics to characterize their distribution is more useful than typical approaches that tend to focus on measuring average values only. In this paper, we describe the development of a real-time quantile-based resource utilization estimator module for wireless networks. The intensive processing tasks run on the FPGA, while the command and control runs on an embedded ARM processor. The module is implemented by using high level synthesis (HLS) on a Xilinx's Zynq-7000 series all programmable system on chip board. We test the performance of the implemented quantile estimator module, and as an example, we focus on forecasting congestion with real frequency channel utilization data. We compare the results from the implemented module against the results from a theoretical quantile estimator. We show that with high accuracy and in real time, the implemented module can perform quantile estimation and can be utilized to perform forecasting of congestion in wireless frequency spectrum utilization. © 2013 IEEE.},

Frequency scanning antenna arrays are able to simultaneously excite a broad angular domain by delaying a wideband signal at each antenna element by a fixed time in the order of the reciprocal of the bandwidth fB. Thus, we are able to obtain a bijective mapping of conventional temporal baseband frequencies f and the broadside angles of the antenna array. Such an additional high frequency hardware component at the BS enables a UE to estimate its preferred AoD through a simple spectrum analysis, as each temporal frequency can be demapped to its corresponding spatial frequency or AoD. Based on this, a downlink beam probing can be defined which simultaneously finds optimal AoDs for each UE, thereby reducing the typically large timing overhead of beam alignment, and enabling millimeter wave (mmWave) communication in scenarios suffering from short coherence times due to high mobility and high spatial resolution. In this paper, we further demonstrate that by oversampling the received power spectrum and exploiting the correlation between samples, the AoD estimation can be refined using a linear minimum mean square error estimator. Without affecting time efficiency, we are able to achieve AoD estimates with a mean error of less than 3◦ even for small antenna geometries with 8 antenna elements and SNR = 0dB. © WSA 2020.},

	abstract = {Recently, subsynchronous oscillations (SSOs) have occurred frequently due to the interaction between wind farm controllers and transmission networks. When an SSO occurs, subsynchronous and supersynchronous interharmonics are present in a voltage/current signal. Because SSOs are serious threats to power system safety and stability, it is important to study subsynchronous and supersynchronous interharmonic phasor and frequency estimators for SSO identification and monitoring (thus for mitigation equipment operation). The systematic errors of the Taylor-Fourier multifrequency model-based parameter estimator are analyzed theoretically. It is found that the key to high estimation accuracy is to select interharmonic and fundamental model frequencies as accurately as possible. To this end, the three-point interpolated discrete Fourier transform and an iteration scheme are used to select the initial model frequencies and modify them iteratively. Simulation tests show that the interharmonic total vector error (TVE) and frequency error (FE) of the proposed method are always below 0.6% and 25 mHz, respectively. The fundamental TVE and FE limits in the IEEE standard can also be fully met, and the computation time can meet the requirements of high reporting rate phasor measurement units. In addition, the current samples recorded in an SSO event are used to demonstrate the real benefits of the proposed method. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) is an important application of smart grid communication technology used for the remote monitoring and control of smart meters. Broadband powerline communication (BB-PLC) systems could perhaps be used for AMI; however, impulsive noise (IN) greatly degrades performance. In addition to the fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM), IEEE 1901 specifications have defined the other physical layer called wavelet-based OFDM. Even though many existing studies have reported the IN mitigation algorithms for the FFT-based OFDM system, these approaches may not directly apply to the wavelet-OFDM-based PLC systems. In this paper, we propose a robust receiver for PLC systems based on wavelet-OFDM. The proposed receiver comprises a pre-IN mitigation block, an adaptive inverse discrete wavelet transform, and an iterative IN reconstruction block. The iterative cancellation of strong IN samples leads to a gradual improvement in the quality of the received signal. Instead of using the frequency domain approach, we reduce the inter-dependency of the channel estimation and per-subchannel equalization by using the time domain signal processing. Besides, we apply variable step-size adaptive algorithms to reduce the impact of IN during the training processes for the channel estimator and per-subchannel equalizer. In accordance with IEEE 1901 specifications, we built a simulation environment to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Simulation results demonstrated that conventional blanking devices fall short in terms of IN mitigation, and that the proposed scheme is able to achieve performance values approaching those obtained in cases without IN. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The ongoing and unprecedented transformation of power systems leads to a reduction in the number of conventional power plants, which are the classical actuators of the grid. In addition, this development results in a decreasing system inertia, which is expected to yield faster frequency dynamics. Therefore power-electronics-interfaced units have to take over system control tasks and, in particular, frequency control. For this purpose, accurate and fast estimation algorithms for time-varying frequency signals are needed. Motivated by this fact, we propose a time-varying parameter estimator and a tuning criterion, which for sufficiently small initial estimation errors allows to reconstruct the time-varying frequency signal of a symmetric three-phase waveform in finite time. The proposed estimator is derived by using a time-varying version of the super twisting algorithm and its performance is illustrated via numerical examples. © 2019 EUCA.},

	abstract = {Typically, the filter bank multicarrier with offset quadrature amplitude modulation (FBMC-OQAM) bears some impressive properties that make it popular as one of the substitutes to orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) for the upcoming technology of broadband wireless communication systems. Although FBMC-OQAM preserves the multicarrier modulation (MCM) features, its spectrum usually suffers from impairments when subjected to the nonlinear behavior of a power amplifier (PA) which results in spectral re-growth. Due to the spectrum limitation and low energy efficiency foreseen in the forthcoming 5G networks, it is vital to confine the spectrum of the FBMC-OQAM signal within the allocated band of interest. In this paper, the suppression of the spectral re-growth experienced on the FBMC-OQAM signal due to the nonlinear distortion effects introduced by the PA is investigated. The crest factor reduction (CFR) method in combination with an adaptive digital pre-distortion (DPD) are used. The peak windowing technique based on sequential asymmetric superposition windowing (SASW) algorithm is used in the CFR part while the least square estimation with QR-decomposition (LSE/QR) has been used as the coefficient’s estimator and adaptation algorithm in the DPD part. The performance of the two combined techniques has been evaluated on SystemVue2018 simulation platform. The adjacent channel leakage ratio (ACLR) and the error vector magnitude (EVM) have been considered as the performance merits. The simulation results show that the proposed techniques significantly improve the spectrum, first by reducing the PAPR of the FBMC-OQAM signal by about 1.5dB. Secondly, the spectral re-growth has been reduced by about-45.74dB adjacent channel leakage suppression and the error vector magnitude measure has been obtained to be about 7.12%. (-22.95dB). These values lead to better average input power of the FBMC-OQAM signal and improvement in the spectral efficiency and they are in accordance with the 3GPP standard for wideband signals in nonlinear systems. © 2019, Dr D.

	abstract = {This paper deals with the control problem concerning the output voltage frequency and amplitude regulation of a wind system power plant not connected to the supply grid. The wind system configuration includes a horizontal-axis wind-turbine which drives a synchronous generator. An appropriate modeling approach has been adopted for both the wind-turbine and the synchronous generator. The proposed controller makes use of the fuzzy logic environment in order to take advantage of the wind plant system informations integrated into a limited number of equilibrium condition points (input variable - output variable pairs). The fuzzy logic controller described in the present paper merges the most appropriate fuzzy rules clusters, based on the steady state working conditions. Then, thanks to a Least Square Estimator algorithm, the proposed control algorithm evaluates, for each sample time, the linear relation between control law correction and control tracking error levels. In order to demonstrate robustness of the suggested fuzzy control algorithm, two sets of results have been provided: the first one consider a fuzzy base with equally spaced rules, whereas, in the second set results, the number of fuzzy rules is reduced by a 25%. © 2020 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

Numerous studies on the control schemes are being conducted to generate electrical energy from the available wind energy using doubly fed induction generator (DFIG). In this study a new control strategy has been suggested. A micro wind energy conversion system has been designed with a sensor-less vector control technique to control the rotor side converter, to force the generator to operate at a constant speed irrespective of variable mechanical input torque due to variable wind speed, keeping the frequency and voltage of the output power constant. To estimate the speed and position of the rotor a model reference adaptive system (TARC-MRAS) based on two axes rotor current is proposed which is compared to the speed measured by the encoder to validate its proper execution Also the speed estimators performance will be investigated during start-up, acceleration, and deceleration of the generator to confirm its usability. A 5 hp wound type induction generator coupled with 5 kW dc motor is used for the experiment. Performance of the propose single VSC based DFIG along with a BESS and Dump load controller has been analyzed under different conditions. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {An optimized hardware architecture for fast normalized cross-correlation (NCC) is essential in real-time high-speed applications. Typical applications of NCC are in object localization, as one of the best motion estimators and as a similarity measure in the field of image processing. However, high computational cost is a significant drawback of NCC. To reduce computation time and hardware resource usages, this paper presents a feed-forward single-path architecture with parallel computation of numerator and denominator components of NCC. The cross-correlation of two signals is implemented in the frequency domain using pipelined architecture of 2D FFT with polyphase sequential subband decomposition technique. The FFT can be determined for any even length of signal when compared to the traditional method involving a power of two-signal length. The proposed pipelined architecture of NCC is more efficient in terms of computational complexity and memory requirement. This proposed architecture is implemented in Verilog HDL with fixed-point data type which helps to devise simple and efficient architecture, which gives excellent SQNR of more than 90 dB with 22-bit output word length. It can operate at the maximum clock frequency of 220.4MHz, takes a total NCC time of 4.36μs and has a latency of 996 cycles, giving a throughput of 220 Msamples/s for a block size of 24×24 pixels using Virtex-7 FPGA. This pipelined architecture not only offers an attractive solution for different sizes of image block, but also improves the speed of the system. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

	abstract = {Previous work by the author referred to a spare capacity estimator that was under development as the “Bedford Estimator”. This paper formally assigns the name Spare Capacity OPerations Estimator (SCOPE) to the metric. Although initially tailored for compensatory tracking tasks using a display (where the tracked error signal is known), SCOPE’s capabilities have been expanded to accommodate various applications. Previously the author showed how control rate and error rate can be used to estimate workload by employing the General Power Law and psychophysical principles. It is demonstrated that the workload estimator implicates the error rate power spectral density, shaped by pilot compensation, as the physical workload stimulus. Analysis of the Crossover Model output within the bandwidth of operation shows that nulling error rate should play a key role in pilot control strategy, hence error rate should be a dominant influence on workload. A model is proposed where the pilot timeshares between error rate nulling and error control based on maximum and minimum error thresholds. Error rate is visually sensed via a washout filter whose break frequency is set by the presence or absence of physical self-motion. It is shown why stick motion by itself does not provide a good estimate of workload, and how pilot compensation must be accounted for when using stick activity to compute workload. SCOPE’s range of application is substantially enhanced by two workload estimation techniques that use alternate information when the error signal being tracked is unknown. The first technique approximates pilot compensation from the vehicle dynamics which are used in the Crossover Model, and the second employs the vehicle output. Practical application of SCOPE’s workload estimation techniques is demonstrated using experimental data collected from a tracking task. Correlation between SCOPE’s workload estimate and pilot Bedford ratings was very high (0.93). Crossover frequency (which is needed for the Crossover Model) is estimated from the pilot data using the recently developed Equivalent Crossover System identification method. SCOPE results are compared with the Dynamic Interface Modeling and Simulation System Product Metric (DIMSS-PM) that has often been used to evaluate pilot workload. © 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Moreover, due to the lack of measurements in the electrical distribution system, the pseudo-measurements are needed to insure the observability of the state estimator. Therefore, the very short term load forecasting algorithm that insures the observability and provides reliable backup data in case of sensor malfunction or communication failure is proposed. The proposed very short term load forecasting is based on the wavelet recurrent neural network (WRNN). The historical data used to train the RNN are decomposed into low-frequency, low-high frequency and high frequency components. The neural networks are trained using an extended Kalman filter (EKF) for the low frequency component and using a square root cubature Kalman filter (SCKF) for both low-high frequency and high frequency components. To estimate the system states, state estimation algorithm based SCKF is used. The results demonstrate the theoretical and practical advantages of the proposed methodology. © 2019 IEEE.},

When anchored, the conceptual AUV can generate energy with on-board turbines, and can relocate itself when needed. Model predictive control (MPC)based centralized optimization is used to optimize the locations of a team of AUVs along a cross-stream transect. To maintain an accurate estimate of the transect flow profile, a Kalman filter-based estimator is used to blend flow speed measurements from the AUVs with intermittent auxiliary flow speed data from a High Frequency Radar Network (HFRNet). To characterize the uncertainty of the GS flow profile estimation, variance of flow speed is modeled using tools from Gaussian Process (GP). The MPC strategy proposed in the paper ensures an appropriate balance between learning the exact location of GS jet (termed exploration) and maximizing overall power generation (termed exploitation). The importance of estimating the flow pattern in the transect with high resolution is shown through simulation results. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a linearized discrete charge balance (LDCB) control strategy is proposed for buck converter operating in discontinuous conduction mode (DCM). For DC-DC power converters, discrete charge balance (DCB) control is an attractive approach to improve the output voltage transient response. However, as a non-linear control strategy, the algorithm is complex, which is difficult for implementation. To reduce the complexity, this paper proposes the LDCB control strategy that is derived through linearizing conventional DCB controller. By deriving the differential functions of the DCB control algorithm, the small signal relationship between the input and output of DCB controller is explored. Furthermore, based on the relationship, the LDCB controller is formed through three parallel feed loops to the duty ratio. As a linear control approach, the achieved LDCB controller is greatly simplified for implementation. This not only saves the hardware cost, but also reduces the calculation lag, which provides potential to improve the switching frequency. Besides, since the LDCB controller shares the same small signal model as that of DCB controller, it achieves similar control loop bandwidth and transient performance. Effectiveness of the proposed LDCB control is verified by zero/pole plots, transient analyses and experimental results. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Accurate information about generator rotor speeds and angles plays an important role for power system transient stability online assessment and protection. To address this need, this paper proposes a fast and robust estimation approach based on the model transformation strategy. Thanks to this strategy, the original complex nonlinear model is transformed into a linear one without linerization, which makes the dynamical system observability analysis and the estimation problem significantly easier to solve. The proposed model transformation strategy is achieved by taking the measured generator active power as the input variable and the derived frequency and the rate of change of frequency measurements from the phasor measurement units (PMUs) as the output variables of the dynamical generator model. This allows us to estimate the generator rotor speeds and angles using only local PMU measurements and the swing equations, relaxing the need of a detailed generator model on which the existing dynamic state estimators are based. A robust Kalman filter is also developed to handle data quality problems as the frequency and rate of change of frequency measurements can be biased in presence of severe disturbance or communication issues. Comparison results carried out on the IEEE 39-bus system successfully validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach under various conditions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

The earlier estimation techniques in the literature assume channel noise is Gaussian as in the wireless communication, whereas the recent ones model the corrupted noise more realistic, impulsive, which results in complicated receivers. This study judges the need of impulsive noise modelling and complex receivers. The performances of two Maximum A-Posteriori (MAP) channel estimators proposed for additive Gaussian noise and impulsive noise are compared under impulsive noise. The channel data used in the simulations is taken from the literature and impulsive noise is modelled by Middleton Class A distribution. The results show that the MAP estimator, which assumes Gaussian noise instead of impulsive, has better performance. The MAP estimator which assumes impulsive noise has a satisfactory performance under weak impulsive noise and low Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) only, otherwise its performance is low, close to Maximum Likelihood estimator performance. The estimator designed for Gaussian noise has a better performance even under heavy impulsive noise and this distinction is clearer for low SNR cases. © 2019, The Korean Institute of Electrical Engineers.},

This method is based on the estimation of the Probability Density Function(PDF) of the soft observed samples. We first of all use the Gaussian Mixture Method (GMM) distribution model to motivate the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm in a fairly informal way. GMM is a simple linear superposition of Gaussian components, aimed at providing a richer class of density models than the single Gaussian. The optimal number of Gaussians is computed by using Mutual Information theory. Simulation results are presented for the proposed BER estimator in the frame work of a multiuser Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) system and shows that attractive performance is achieved. These results show that GMM technique provides a good fit to our data samples and thus provides better performance in the sense of minimum variance of the estimator. This drastically reduces the needed number of samples required to estimate the BER in order to reduce the required simulation run-time, even at low BER. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes and analyzes a mmWave sparse channel estimation technique for OFDM systems that uses the Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) algorithm. This greedy algorithm retrieves one additional multipath component (MPC) per iteration until a stop condition is met. We obtain an analytical approximation for the OMP estimation error variance that grows with the number of retrieved MPCs (iterations). The OMP channel estimator error variance outperforms a classic maximum-likelihood (ML) non-sparse channel estimator by a factor of approximately 2L/M where L is the number of retrieved MPCs (iterations) and M the number of taps of the Discrete Equivalent Channel. When the MPC amplitude distribution is heavy-tailed, the channel power is concentrated in a subset of dominant MPCs. In this case OMP performs fewer iterations as it retrieves only these dominant large MPCs. Hence for this MPC amplitude distribution the estimation error advantage of OMP over ML is improved. In particular, for channels with MPCs that have lognormally-distributed amplitudes, the OMP estimator recovers approximately 5-15 dominant MPCs in typical mmWave channels, with 15-45 weak MPCs that remain undetected. © 2019 IEEE.},

We use the hardware event counters from the processor performance monitoring unit (PMU) to accurately capture the CPU states and ordinary least squares (OLS), assisted by automated event selection algorithms, to compute the power models. Several estimators for single-thread and multi-thread benchmarks are proposed capable of performing power predictions across different frequency levels for one processor as well as between the heterogeneous processors with less than 3% error. The models are compared to related work showing significant improvement in accuracy and good computational efficiency which makes them suitable for run-time deployment.

	abstract = {To achieve frequency regulation, energy-storage systems (ESSs) are systems that monitor and maintain the grid frequency. In South Korea, the total installed capacity of battery ESSs (BESSs) is 376 MW, and these have been employed to achieve frequency regulation since 2015. When the frequency of a power grid is input, accurately estimating the state of charge (SOC) of a battery is difficult because it charges or discharges quickly according to the frequency regulation algorithm. If the SOC of a battery cannot be estimated, the battery can be used in either a high SOC or low SOC. This makes the battery unstable and reduces the safety of the ESS system. Therefore, it is important to precisely estimate the SOC. This paper proposes a technique to estimate the SOC in the test pattern of a frequency regulation ESS using extended Kalman filters. In addition, unlike the conventional extended Kalman filter input with a fixed-error covariance, the SOC is estimated using an adaptive extended Kalman filter (AEKF) whose error covariance is updated according to the input data. Noise is likely to exist in the environment of frequency regulation ESSs, and this makes battery-state estimation more difficult. Therefore, significant noise has been added to the frequency regulation test pattern, and this study compares and verifies the estimation performance of the proposed AEKF and a conventional extended Kalman filter using measurement data with severe noise. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a state feedback primary control strategy for microgrids with multiple distributed energy resource units, improving their transient behavior in both islanded and grid-connected modes of operation. To that end, the interaction of each distributed energy resource unit within the microgrid is modeled as a lumped dynamic system, which results to be nonlinear and multivariable. For the closed-loop control of such multivariable systems, the full state feedback formulation is preferred which requires a suitable state observer. For the design of the observer and feedback gains, the solution of the linear-quadratic estimation and regulation problems is considered. For simplicity, an approximate linear model at a representative operating point is derived. The linear quadratic Gaussian/loop-transfer recovery is adopted as the design procedure to optimize the trajectory of the state variables subject to a desirable actuation effort, in this case of the voltage amplitude and frequency, yielding a solution that is robust to model uncertainties. The effectiveness of the strategy is assessed through time-domain simulation on the CIGRE benchmark medium-voltage distribution network with three distributed energy resource units. These results are compared to those obtained with conventional static droop gains and with a state-of-the-art technique from the literature. © 2010-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Due to the highly increasing integration of renewable energy sources with the power grid and their fluctuations, besides the recent growth of new power electronics equipment, the noise in power systems has become colored. The colored noise affects the methodologies for power quality parameters’ estimation, such as harmonic and interharmonic components. Estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance techniques (ESPRIT) as a parametric technique with high resolution has proven its efficiency in the estimation of power signal components’ frequencies, amplitudes, and phases for quality analysis, under the assumption of white Gaussian noise. Since ESPRIT suffers from high computational effort, filter bank ESPRIT (FB-ESPRIT) was suggested for mitigation of the complexity. This manuscript suggests FB-ESPRIT as well for accurate and robust estimation of power signal components’ parameters in the presence of the colored noise. Even though the parametric techniques depend on the Gaussianity of contaminating noise to perform properly, FB-ESPRIT performs well in colored noise. The FB-ESPRIT superiority compared with the conventional ESPRIT and MUSIC techniques was demonstrated through many simulations runs on synthetic power signals with multiple harmonics, interharmonics, and subharmonic components in the presence of noises of different colors and different SNR levels. FB-ESPRIT had a significant efficiency superiority in power quality analysis with a wide gap distance from the other estimators, especially under the high level of colored noise. © 2019 by the authors.

	abstract = {Manuscript type: An empirical analysis of the relationship between country-level governance and share markets in the Asia-Pacific region was carried out using dynamic value at risk (Dynamic VaR), mixed data sample (MIDAS) and exponential generalised autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (EGARCH) models. Research question/issue: Is there a relationship between a country’s governance and stock market in terms of the level of returns and share price volatility? We hypothesise that stock returns for countries with higher levels of governance will have lower ex ante expected returns and less volatility than countries with lower levels of governance. Research findings/insights: It is evident from the empirical findings that there is still significant diversity in both corporate-level governance and country-level governance within the Asia-Pacific region. The results from using mixed data sample-autoregressive distributed lag (MIDAS-ADL) model correlation between world governance index (WGI) and the dynamic VaR suggest that the estimators of high frequency slope for India, China and Malaysia are negative. In addition, their t statistics show that the correlation is significant; meanwhile, their goodness of fit is also very high confirming the explanation power of MIDAS-AD model. Consequently, the capital market performances of India, China and Malaysia are negatively related to their corporate-level governance and country-level governance. However, China has a positive correlation between WGI and corporate-level governance and country-level governance. This uncommon phenomenon may be the result of its special political system and the segregation of the capital market and the real economy. Theoretical/academic implications: The linkage between country-level governance and volatility of stocks in Asia-Pacific markets indicates there is scope to reduce stock price volatility through enhanced national governance. Volatility as an indicator of risk reflects market uncertainty in terms of processing information signals to find the equilibrium return risk nexus. Consequently, researchers have to incorporate the data of different frequency into the same equation using robust methods. Practitioner/policy implications: Regulatory frameworks encompassing stock markets will benefit from a more focussed consideration of the way in which governance and risk are correlated. Findings from the generalised autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) and VaR analysis are that stock market volatility is a suitable proxy for the governance of a country. As country governance indices are annual at best, volatility measures give more timely readings. An increase in volatility suggests there is a decline in national governance, and this has implications for those involved in trade, donor organisations and international lending agencies such as the World Bank. © 2019 Institute of Public Enterprise.},

This paper proposes a hypothesis test (HT)-based algorithm and a support vector machine (SVM)-based algorithm for the SFBC signals' identification over frequency-selective fading channels to exploit two-dimensional space-frequency domain redundancy. Based on the central limit theorem, space-domain redundancy is used to construct the cross-correlation function of the estimator and frequency-domain redundancy is incorporated in the construction of the statistics. The difference between two proposed algorithms is that the HT-based algorithm constructs a chi-square statistic and employs an HT to make the decision, while the SVM-based algorithm constructs a non-central chi-square statistic with unknown mean as a strongly distinguishable statistical feature and uses SVM to make the decision. Both the algorithms do not require knowledge of the channel coefficients, modulation type, or noise power, and the SVM-based algorithm does not require timing synchronization. The simulation results verify the superior performance of the proposed algorithms for short observation periods with comparable computational complexity to conventional algorithms, as well as their acceptable identification performance in the presence of transmission impairments. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {To address the problem of voltage deviation and uneven distribution of reactive power in island microgrid caused by traditional droop control and line impedance mismatch, this paper proposes a distributed layered control strategy based on self-triggered consistency algorithm. In the secondary control layer of microgrid, the global average estimator of voltage and reactive power is constructed by using the consistency algorithm, and the deviation of voltage and reactive power in the primary control layer are adjusted based on the quantity of compensation. Considering that network intruders perform Denial of Service(DoS) attacks on communication network at the secondary control layer under Cyber-Physical Systems(CPS) environments and block the information exchanges between agents, which leads to deterioration in the performance of the consistency algorithm, this paper gives a consistency algorithm based on ternary control with self-triggered communication strategy. By introducing an attack detection function to overcome the constraints on the frequency of DoS attacks, the strategy achieves on-demand communication while enhancing the robustness against DoS attacks. Simulation results show that the proposed control strategy can recover the voltage deviation and guarantee the even distribution of reactive power in microgrid, and ensure the convergence performance of the consistency algorithm under DoS attacks. © 2020, Editorial Office of Computer Engineering.

	abstract = {Linear infinite dimensional systems are described by a closed, densely defined linear operator that generates a continuous semigroup of bounded operators on a general Hilbert space of states and are controlled via a finite number of actuators and sensors. Many distributed applications are included in this formulation, such as large flexible aerospace structures, adaptive optics, diffusion reactions, smart electric power grids, and quantum information systems. Using a recently developed normal form for these systems, we have developed the following stability result: an infinite dimensional linear system is Almost Strictly Dissipative (ASD) if and only if its high frequency gain CB is symmetric and positive definite and the open loop system is minimum phase, i.e. its transmission zeros are all exponentially stable.In this paper, we focus on infinite dimensional linear systems that are non-minimum phase because a finite number of zeros are unstable. We previously developed a blending method to compensate for this issue where we modify or blend the output of the infinite dimensional plant, and then control this modified output rather than the original control output. In this paper we use a finite dimensional zero dynamics estimator based on a modified output but use the estimator to produce a fully minimum phase system. Then direct adaptive control for the infinite dimensional plant can focus on the original control output rather than the modified output. These results are illustrated by application to direct adaptive control of general linear systems on a Hilbert space that are described by self-adjoint operators with compact resolvent. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Low-resolution analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is a promising solution to reduce hardware cost and power consumption in generalized frequency division multiplexing (GFDM) systems. The severe nonlinear distortion of ADCs and the non-orthogonality of GFDM make receiver design a great challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel model-driven receiver architecture for GFDM with low-resolution ADCs. Orthogonal approximate message passing (OAMP) framework is combined with the classical linear estimator in this work to create a robust iterative receiver for GFDM systems with low-precision ADCs. The corresponding model-driven network is organized based on the proposed novel iterative algorithm according to the procedures of the receiver. The network of OAMP can reduce the gap between the approximate algorithm and the Bayesian optimal result due to the information loss of ADCs. The signal flow of the neural network is designed by unfolding the iterative algorithms for channel estimation and data detection.

	abstract = {In this letter, we propose a novel estimator for pilot-aided orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) channels in an additive Gaussian and impulsive perturbation environment. Due to sensor failure which might happen because of man-made noise, a number of measurements in high rate communication systems is often corrupted by impulsive noise. High power impulsive noise is generally an obstacle for OFDM systems as valuable information will be completely lost. To overcome this concern, an objective function based on a penalized atomic norm minimization (PANM) is provided in order to promote the sparsity of time dispersive channels and impulsive noise. The corresponding dual problem of the PANM is then converted to tractable semidefinite programming. It has shown that one can simultaneously estimate the time dispersive channels in a continuous dictionary and the location of impulsive noise using the dual problem. Several numerical experiments are carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed estimator. © 1997-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Doubly selective (DS) channel estimation for the downlink massive multiple-input-multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems is a challenging problem, due to the requirements on high pilots overhead and prohibitive complexity. In this paper, by exploiting the highly correlated spatial structure of the obtained array response vectors and sparsity of the multipath signal components of the massive MIMO-OFDM channels, a modified spatial basis expansion model (modified-SBEM) is introduced. Thus, using complex exponential (CE-) modified-SBEM (i.e., modified CE-SBEM) can improve the resolution of the angles of departures (AoDs) information to represent the downlink with far fewer parameter dimensions, since the AoDs are much slower than path gains. Subsequently, we jointly design the effective pilot power and pilot placement for sparse channel estimation by means of an extended model. Our design is based on the block-coherence and sub-coherence simultaneous minimization of the measurement matrix associated with the massive MIMO-OFDM system pilot subcarriers. Furthermore, we leverage the sparse nature of the massive MIMO-OFDM system to formulate the quantized AoDs estimation into a block-sparse signal recovery problem, where the measurement matrix is designed based on the estimated virtual AoD. Thus, a new algorithm namely, generalized quasi-block simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit (gQBSO), is introduced to solve the problem by providing sparse signal reconstruction solution. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can effectively estimate the DS channel for massive MIMO-OFDM systems compared with other existing algorithms. For example, at SNR=20 dB for K=4 users, Doppler shift=0.093 with NT=32 antenna size, the adaptive-QBSO algorithm with G-SBEM and the proposed gQBSO with modified-SBEM can realize approximately 75.44%and 85.14% of the NMSE achieved by the oracle estimator with modified-SBEM. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a low-complexity joint extrapolation-multiple signal classification (MUSIC)-based 2-D parameter estimator is proposed for vital frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar. Recently, an FMCW radar, which can detect the distance and vital Doppler information, has been considered for vital non-contact radar. In the conventional FMCW radar system, fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based algorithms with low complexity are used to extract multiple parameters. However, the resolution and accuracy of an FFT-based parameter estimator are considerably low. Thus, 2-D high-resolution algorithms, such as the 2-D estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance techniques and 2-D MUSIC, have been suggested as an alternative method. However, a large computation power is required compared with the FFT-based methods. Therefore, this paper proposes a 2-D parameter estimator that combines extrapolated FFT and MUSIC to reduce the computational load for vital detection. The proposed method uses an extrapolated FFT to overcome the disadvantages of the low-resolution FFT for the distance information, and then, the 1-D MUSIC algorithm is applied to the Doppler domain direction only for the extracted magnitude and phase information of the target's extrapolated FFT results. Hence, the proposed algorithm combines the advantages of FFT and MUSIC. The performance of the proposed estimation is compared with that of other algorithms using Monte Carlo simulation results. The root-mean-square error of the proposed method is compared with that of 2-D MUSIC with various parameters. To verify the performance of the proposed combination method, the FMCW radar was used, and its performance was verified in an indoor environment. © 2001-2012 IEEE.},

The regulation methodology is based on analyzing the relationship between the angular slip frequency and the torque angle. To reduce the inherent coupling between the electromagnetic and mechanical variables of the IM, a modified mathematical model of IM is presented in which the nonlinearity degree is effectively reduced and thus perfect decoupling can be achieved at steady state and transient operation as well. A robust speed estimator is proposed based on a modified flux estimator. In order to show the effectiveness of the overall control procedure, the drive performance is tested for a wide range of speed variation. The obtained results validate the feasibility of the proposed PCC and verify its robustness against the system's uncertainties. © 2019 IEEE.},

The accurate estimation of time-varying subsynchronous frequency component is necessary for the identification, monitoring, and control of the SSCI. In this work, Kalman filtering approach is utilized to recursively extract the time-varying subsynchronous frequency component. The proposed methodology is first verified on benchmark signals under fixed and time-varying subsynchronous components. Then, it is validated on an actual wind power system suffering from SSCI.

Due to a limited 180 kHz bandwidth, the time-domain auto-correlation function (ACF) of transmitted NB positioning reference signal (NPRS) has a wide main-lobe. Without considering that, the performance of ToA estimation can be degraded for two reasons. Firstly, the NPRS corresponding to different received paths are superimposed on each other under multipath propagation. Secondly, the measured peak-to-average power-ratio (PAPR) for detecting the presence of NPRS is inaccurate. Therefore, in this letter we propose a space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) based method to estimate the number of channel taps, coefficients, and corresponding delays, with taking the imperfect ACF of NPRS into consideration. The proposed ToA estimator only uses time-domain cross-correlations between the received signal and the transmitted NPRS, which yields a low computational-cost. We show through simulations that, it performs close to maximum likelihood (ML) estimator under flat-fading channels, and is superior than traditional estimators under frequency-selective fading channels. © 2019 IEEE.},

In hybrid RF/VLC, data rate maximization is subject to constraints on bandwidth, power and the user association. The joint optimization problem of bandwidth, power and user association to maximize the data rate is non-concave and obtaining an optimal solution is difficult with conventional optimization algorithms. The existing solutions are based on a presumption of at least one optimization variable. In this article, this issue has been overcome by solving the joint optimization problem in hybrid RF/VLC with a deep Q-network (DQN) learning based algorithm, which has been recognized as an efficient learning based mechanism for optimization. Our system model considers one RF and multiple VLC access points (APs). The idle APs are also incorporated in the system model. The application of DQN learning based algorithm is carried out by finding an optimal policy with the help of an action-value function. As the data sets for the considered system are large, a multi-layered network is used for approximating the action-value function estimator. Finally, a transfer learning based algorithm has been proposed for maximizing the total data rate of the system for the case of a newly entering user equipment (UE) that uses the information of the environment before the arrival of the new UE. Through simulations, it is found that our proposed algorithms can lead to an improvement of more than 10% and 54% in the achievable sum-rate and number of iterations for convergence respectively as compared to that obtained with existing conventional optimization algorithms. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Graphics-intensive mobile games place different and varying levels of demand on the associated central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs). In contrast to the workload variability that characterizes games, the current design of the energy governor employed by mobile systems appears to be outdated. In this paper, we review the energy-saving mechanism implemented in an Android system coupled with graphics-intensive gaming workloads from three perspectives: 1) user perception; 2) application status; and 3) the interplay between the CPU and GPU. We observe that there are information gaps in the current system, which may result in unnecessary energy wastage. To resolve the problem, we propose an online user-centric CPU-GPU governing framework. To bridge the identified information gaps, we classify rendered game frames into redundant/changing frames to satisfy user demand, categorize an application into GPU sensitive/insensitive phases to understand the application's demand, and determine the frequency scaling intents of the CPU and GPU to capture processor demand. In response to the measured demand, we employ a required workload estimator, a unified policy selector, and a frequency-scaling intent communicator in the framework to save energy. The proposed framework was implemented on an LG Nexus 5X smartphone, and extensive experiments with real-world 3-D gaming applications were conducted. According to the experiment results, for an application which is low interactive and infrequent phase changing, the proposed framework can, respectively, reduce energy consumption by 25.3% and 39% compared with our previous work and Android governors while maintaining user experience. © 1982-2012 IEEE.},

We propose a quantization-aware data-detection algorithm which mitigates the performance loss of 1-bit quantized massive MIMO orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. Since the system performance heavily depends on the quality of channel estimates, we also develop a nonlinear 1-bit channel estimation algorithm that builds upon the proposed data detection algorithm. We show that the proposed algorithms significantly outperform linear data detectors and channel estimators in terms of bit error rate. For the proposed nonlinear data detection algorithm, we develop a very large scale integration (VLSI) architecture and present implementation results on a Xilinx Virtex-7 field programmable gate array (FPGA). Our implementation results are, to the best of our knowledge, the first for 1-bit massive MU-MIMO-OFDM systems and demonstrate comparable hardware efficiency with respect to state-of-the-art linear data detectors designed for systems with high-resolution data converters, while achieving lower bit error rate. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Massive antenna array has been proposed to improve the spectral efficiency and link reliability in wireless communication systems. However, using large antenna arrays incurs additional cost in terms of signal processing and hardware complexity. The electromagnetic (EM) lens-focusing antennas are introduced as a promising technique to reduce the hardware complexity and cost. On the other hand, determining the location of users in terms of their direction-of-arrival (DoA) using these lens array becomes of great interest for different 5G services. This paper addresses the issue of DoA estimation by adopting lens antenna array (LNA). We firstly derive an expression for the received signal with the adoption of LNA, and then a maximum likelihood (ML) estimator for the DoA has been obtained. Depending on the ability of the lens array to focus the signal power on a subset of antennas as a function of DoA. We propose using the antenna selection (AS) technology to select an antenna subset aiming to reduce the number of radio frequency (RF) chains and accordingly reducing the hardware cost. The simulation results show the the capability of the proposed method to avoid the phase ambiguity problem and provide high accurate DoA estimation of signals. © 2019, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Alternative positioning techniques, such as those using ambient signals-of-opportunity, have been increasingly developed for global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-challenging urban and indoor environments. For instance, cellular long-term evolution (LTE) network supports a variety of positioning methods based on signal measurements such as received signal strength or time-of-arrival (TOA). Carrier phase measurement extracted from LTE signals has also received substantial attention due to its potential high ranging accuracy. This paper presents a closed-loop (CL) carrier phase tracking architecture for positioning in LTE networks with robustness to the channel fading effects. The pilot cell-specific reference signal (CRS) is exploited for generating the channel estimation results, which are inputs for the carrier phase discriminator to measure the carrier phase error. The undesired bias corrupting the phase discriminator output for multipath channels is analytically derived. Then, the state-space model of LTE carrier signal tracking in light of the specific CRS time-frequency domain pattern is established and the state estimator gain matrix is derived based on the proportional integral filter deign. Simulation assessment of the proposed carrier phase tracking architecture is performed in a single path Rician fading channel under different Rician factors and signal powers. The impact of loop parameters, e.g., loop bandwidth and updating interval, is investigated. Real collected LTE data in a multipath fading channel is also used to comparatively analyze the performances of the existing open-loop and proposed CL carrier tracking methods combined with three LTE signal TOA estimators. The proposed algorithm in conjunction with the multipath estimating delay lock loop is shown to provide accurate and robust carrier phase measurements against multipath fading effects compared to other considered tracking schemes. © 2020 Proceedings of the 33rd International Technical Meeting of the Satellite Division of the Institute of Navigation, ION GNSS+ 2020.

The modified self-cancelling technology provides the best performance in respect of the CIR and the Bit-Error (BER) ratio only compared with the conventional technique. The adder module interference estimator also often needs data path units in this paper. Mostly as a result, a detailed explanation is still based on increasing the delay in capacity of the adder. The Ripple adductor and the output of the skip adder of each step depends on the previous carrier, but once it is returned to hold tree adders, it produces the transmission signals in O(log n) time and is regarded to have been the simplest and best VLSI output.

However, digital control with EADC involves challenges in achieving soft-start without an output voltage undershoot or using a complex circuit, which increases the circuit cost and power loss. To overcome the aforementioned problems, this brief proposes an open-loop soft-start strategy without undershoot for a digital-controlled power converter based on an EADC. The proposed strategy does not require a digital-to-analog converter and accurate wide-range analog front-end circuit. A duty ratio estimator and design considerations were established to achieve a seamless open-loop/closed-loop transition for avoiding a large output voltage undershoot. The proposed control can be applied to various types of power converters. It was verified through simulations with a buck converter. Finally, a buck converter experiment was performed to verify the proposed strategy, in which the output voltage was within a {V} -{o} dynamic range of ± 5% after start-up. © 2004-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Frequency response masking (FRM) approach, is widely used to reduce the transition width of FIR filter which includes several advantages like lower coefficient sensitivity, higher computation speed and low power consumption. This paper proposes a novel interpolated bandpass method (IBM) for the synthesis of linear phase, narrow transition band FIR filter with less complexity. Simulation results have shown the magnitude response of several lowpass FIR filters with narrow transition bandwidth, as designed with the aid of proposed approach. Supremacy of the proposed algorithm has also been established in terms of frequency response characteristics and hardware complexity over a number of state-of-the-art techniques of recent interest. Simulation results have identified an improvement of ∼18.89%, 44.62%, 38.75%, 41.2% and 29.5% in terms of transition bandwidth when compared with several example filters under consideration. In addition to this, hardware cost resulting from the proposed narrow-band FIR filter is analyzed by implementing it on Artix field programmable gate array (FPGA) chip and consequently power consumption of the resulting filter has been estimated using Xilinx Power Estimator (XPE)-2018.1. Finally, the designed narrow transition band FIR filter is used in filtered-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (F-OFDM) based quadrature amplitude modulated (QAM) system and the resultant bit error rate (BER) performance has been studied. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The dominant noise in narrowband powerline communication (NB-PLC) systems is cyclostationary impulsive noise (IN), which severely degrades communication performance. Conventionally, a frequency shift (FRESH) filtering approach exploits the cyclostationary effect to extract the IN component in the received signal. In this paper, we propose a three-stage adaptive FRESH-based cyclostationary noise estimator to make a reliable IN estimation. Inspired by the active noise cancellation method, we firstly employ a FRESH filter to generate a reference IN signal. In addition, considering the cyclostationarity of the IN, we exploit the time-averaged objective function to adjust the coefficients of the FRESH filter. Then, this reference IN signal is fed into an adaptive estimator to further refine the estimation of IN. Lastly, the refined IN estimations are rectified by a hard thresholding device such that significant and reliable IN estimations can be leached out. By subtracting the reliable IN estimations from the received signal, we mitigate the impact of IN on the data transmission for NB-PLC systems. Computer simulation is conducted based on the IEEE 1901.2 specification and we use real measured IN data to verify the effectiveness of our proposed method. The results have shown that the improvement in terms of the normalized mean squared error can be up to 7.57 dB. © 2019},

	abstract = {The proliferation of ubiquitous computing applications created a multi-dimensional optimization problem that includes several conflicting variables such as spectral efficiency, complexity, power consumption, delay, and error probability. To relax the problem and provide efficient solutions, it was necessary to augment the currently overutilized radio spectrum with new frequency bands such as the optical spectrum, which can be used to off-load some of the traffic of certain applications. Therefore, this paper presents an efficient system design that uses amplitude-coherent (AC) detection to reduce the complexity of optical wireless communication systems (OWC), improve its reliability and spectral efficiency. More specifically, we use amplitude shift keying with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) at the transmitter, and AC detection at the receiver. The complexity reduction is achieved by using a low complexity detector, channel estimator, and peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) reduction scheme. The spectral efficiency is achieved by using real data symbols with discrete cosine transform (DCT), which requires a subcarrier spacing that is 50% of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), and does not require Hermitian symmetry to generate real-valued OFDM signals. Moreover, the derived channel estimator is blind, and the PAPR reduction scheme does not require a feedback overhead between the transmitter and receiver. © 2020 IEEE. All rights reserved.},

Direct current biased optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DCO-OFDM) is commonly used in VLC where half of the available subcarriers are spent to guarantee a real-valued output after the inverse fast Fourier transform operation. Besides, dedicated subcarriers are typically used for CE, thus, many resources are wasted and the spectral efficiency is degraded. We propose a superimposed training approach for CE in MISO DCO-OFDM VLC scenarios. Analytical expressions of mean squared error (MSE) and spectral efficiency are derived when the least squares estimator is considered. This analysis is valid for outdoor and indoor scenarios. For the CE error, simulation results of MSE show a perfect match with analytical expressions. Moreover, results prove that this technique guarantees a larger spectral efficiency than previous schemes where dedicated pilots were used. Finally, the optimal data power allocation factor is also analytically derived. © 1967-2012 IEEE.},

The widely used windowed interpolation fast Fourier transform (WIFFT) can only reduce, but not completely remove, the estimation errors at the cost of an increment in the computation burden of frequency estimation. This paper proposes a frequency estimator by using the prior rough frequency estimation and trigonometric decomposition under white Gaussian noises. Firstly, a prior rough frequency is estimated by the three spectral lines WIFFT based on the Hanning window. Then, a parallel iteration of trigonometric decomposition is applied for the accurate frequency estimation. The gradient-descent method is used in the parallel iteration procedure, which can effectively restrain the interferences from harmonics and noise. Simulation and experiments results show that the proposed method can achieve accurate frequency estimation within one cycle. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

	abstract = {Accurate local bus frequency is essential for power system frequency regulation provided by distributed energy sources, flexible loads, and among others. This paper proposes a robust frequency divider (RFD) for online bus frequency estimation. Our RFD is independent of the load models, and the knowledge of swing equation parameters, transmission line parameters, and local Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU) measurements at each generator terminal bus is sufficient. In addition, it is able to handle several types of data quality issues, such as measurement noise, gross measurement errors, cyberattacks, and measurement losses. Furthermore, the proposed RFD contains the decentralized estimation of local generator rotor speeds and the centralized bus frequency estimation, which resembles the structure of the decentralized/hierarchical control scheme. This enables RFD for very large-scale system applications. Specifically, we decouple each generator from the rest of the system by treating metered real power injection as inputs and the frequency measurements provided by PMU as outputs; then a robust unscented Kalman filter based dynamic state estimator is proposed for local generator rotor speed estimation; finally, these rotor speeds are transmitted to control center for bus frequency estimation. Numerical results carried out on the IEEE 39-bus and 145-bus systems demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. © 1969-2012 IEEE. 0885-8950 © 2017 IEEE.

	abstract = {Multiple-input multiple-output antenna-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) is one of the most wanted wireless broadband technology and transmission systems that has been accepted as the basis of fourth generation (4G) wireless communication is MIMO-OFDM. It is so flexible and adaptable to stay in power even in the coming up 5G technologies. The relative motion of the transmitter and receiver can bring alteration in the channel within the time period of an OFDM, hence OFDM causes loss of orthogonally between sub carrier which results in inter-carrier interference. In order to overcome these issues, an adaptive modulation and interference cancellation technique for MIMO-OFDM wireless network are proposed. Along with interference cancellation technique, adaptive modulation is used to meet the required BER performance by selecting suitable modulation modes based on the channel condition. Doppler assisted channel estimation method is used to estimate the channel. Also, inter channel/carrier interference (ICI) cancellation scheme is used to integrate the parallel interference cancellation together with the decision statistical combining (PIC-DSC) module to detect the data and transmit it to the estimator to iteratively refine the channel and give interference free channel. Simulation results shows that the proposed method improves the BER performance of the system. Copyright © 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

	abstract = {Estimation of the parameters of the power generators are important part of a power system modeling and simulation. A reliable estimation of a synchronous generator parameters can be done using waveforms measured directly on the terminals of the machine. The waveforms are recorded during a carefully chosen disturbance tests of the generating unit. One of the quantities necessary to determine the generator parameters is the deviation of the generator angular speed. However, because of the safety reasons, it is very difficult to get access to the direct measurement of this quantity on a operating generating unit. Angular speed estimation based on a generator stator voltage seems to be an alternative solution to the problem. The aim of the paper is to find a computationally efficient and accurate method of indirect angular speed estimation of a synchronous generator which is based on the recording of its stator voltage during a load rejection test. The algorithms evaluated in the paper are based on Prony's estimator, zero-crossing detection, least-square data fitting and layer recurrent neural network. Paper contains literature survey, mathematical model of the considered generator, analysis of its stator voltage recorded in a power plant, description of the selected algorithms and results of the algorithms estimation using a signal with known frequency variation. Performed algorithms evaluation allows to choose the best solution in terms of accuracy and computational effort. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

Traditionally, in voltage model rotor flux estimator, standard method is to use first order time delay element in place of pure integrator to counter the problem of dc drift and offset. Still, the performance of drive deteriorates when stator frequency is low and at standstill. Here, in addition to first order delay element, a high pass filter is included to reduce the dc offset effect. Also, reference flux space vector is added to the output of voltage model flux estimator, so that at low speed this reference value of flux is the output of the flux observer. In the proposed method, speed is estimated by comparing the torque producing stator current component computed using above flux observer, with reference stator current space vector obtained from speed PI loop. This difference is then fed to the proportional-integrator to minimize the error, generating the rotor speed. The proposed scheme is implemented using indirect field oriented control of induction motor and performance, in all operating conditions, including the critical low stator frequency range is verified using MATLAB Simulation. © 2018 IEEE.},

Since Model Predictive Control (MPC) is based on the fixed predictive model parameters, RPME has been proposed for online identification of plant model parameters (in an ARX form) at each sampling instant. The AMPC updates its plant model, predicts the future control sequences needed for the plant, and adjusts the plant output to follow the reference input at each control interval. The performance of the proposed decentralized wide-area damping control method has been tested using the 179-bus wNAPS system, and is supported by non-linear time-domain simulation. The performance of the online identification-based AMPC is compared with the static model-based MPC and fractional order PID (FOPID) controllers. The results show that the inter-area oscillation damping is more effective for RPME based AMPC controller and the global stability of the system is preserved. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The time-variant vehicle-to-vehicle radio propagation channel in the frequency band from 59.75 to 60.25 GHz has been measured in an urban street in the city center of Vienna, Austria. We have measured a set of 30 vehicle-to-vehicle channel realizations to capture the effect of an overtaking vehicle. Our experiment was designed for characterizing the large-scale fading and the small-scale fading depending on the overtaking vehicle's position. We demonstrate that large overtaking vehicles boost the mean receive power by up to 10 dB. The analysis of the small-scale fading reveals that the two-wave with diffuse power (TWDP) fading model is adequate. By means of the model selection, we demonstrate the regions where the TWDP model is more favorable than the customarily used the Rician fading model. Furthermore, we analyze the time selectivity of our vehicular channel. To precisely define the Doppler and delay resolutions, a multitaper spectral estimator with discrete prolate spheroidal windows is used. The delay and Doppler profiles are inferred from the estimated local scattering function. Spatial filtering by the transmitting horn antenna decreases the delay and Doppler spread values. We observe that the RMS Doppler spread is below one-tenth of the maximum Doppler shift 2f v/c. For example, at 60 GHz, a relative speed of 30 km/h yields a maximum Doppler shift of approximately 3300 Hz. The maximum RMS Doppler spread of all observed vehicles is 450 Hz; the largest observed RMS delay spread is 4 ns. © 2013 IEEE.},

To efficiently identify the operational limit violations, a switch from deterministic to stochastic framework for assessing the system security, which could manage various types of uncertainties, has been advocated in this paper. The established model is based on an improved probabilistic load flow, which is adapted to incorporate the steady-state behavior of frequency regulation. An efficient importance sampling (IS) technique is also developed to speed up the crude Monte Carlo (MC) simulation in estimating the low probability of violations of security constraints. Extensive computational experiments on both the IEEE 14-bus test case and a simplified regional system show that the proposed IS estimator makes significant enhancement to the crude MC in the computational efficiency and has better numerical performance as compared with other IS schemes. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a stable sensorless start-up method of the actual 10MW LCI system and analyzed the characteristic of the existing system for the simulation modeling. The 10MW LCI system is modeled to verify the performance of the proposed sensorless methods, controllers, operating modes and so on. The simulation model is designed by applying the operating conditions of the 10MW actual system and parameters of the 200MVA synchronous machine. The proposed sensorless methods for initial start-up of the gas-turbine is composed of the initial rotor position detector and methods for the low speed and high speed range. The operation mode of the LCI system is divided into the forced commutation mode and natural commutation mode according to the rotor speed, and the sensorless methods are applied differently by the operation mode. The sensorless methods are referred to as closed loop current control and flux estimator. The initial rotor position detector is applied to detect rotor position at the standstill of the machine using an induced back-emf by the injection of a field current, and the estimated error is less than 1%. After estimation of the initial rotor position, the LCI system is operated by the closed loop current control at the forced commutation mode, and it operates at less than 10% of the rated speed. The LCI system is operated from 10% to 90% of the rated speed through the flux estimator for the natural commutation mode, and the rotor speed/position is estimated by the phase locked loop. The performance of proposed sensorless start-up and the operation modes of LCI system is verified by the proposed simulation modeling. © 2018 IEEJ Industry Application Society.},

	abstract = {This paper evaluates the feasibility of applying massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) to tackle the uplink mixed-service communication problem. Under the assumption of an available physical narrowband shared channel, devised to exclusively consume data traffic from machine type communications (MTC) devices, the capacity (i.e., number of connected devices) of MTC networks and, in turn, that of the whole system, can be increased by clustering such devices and letting each cluster share the same time-frequency physical resource blocks. Following this research line, we study the possibility of employing sub-optimal linear detectors to the problem and present a simple and practical channel estimator that works without the previous knowledge of the large-scale channel coefficients. Our simulation results suggest that the proposed channel estimator performs asymptotically, as well as the MMSE estimator, with respect to the number of antennas and the uplink transmission power. Furthermore, the results also indicate that, as the number of antennas is made progressively larger, the performance of the sub-optimal linear detection methods approaches the perfect interference-cancellation bound. The findings presented in this paper shed light on and motivate for new and exciting research lines toward a better understanding of the use of massive MIMO in MTC networks. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Accurate channel state information (CSI) is a key requirement for massive multiple-input multiple-output to achieve multi-fold increases in throughput and secrecy rate. Consequently, an adversary targeting the channel sounding process has the potential to significantly degrade performance. In this paper, we first present and model the pilot distortion attack, a simple but devastating jamming strategy in which the adversary distorts the access point's (AP's) CSI measurement of even a single client leading to denial of service for all clients associated with the AP. We then propose multiple-antenna carrier frequency offset estimate (MACE) as a countermeasure that exploits the AP's antenna array to detect jamming with zero startup cost and zero additional network overhead. Our key insight is that with multiple antennas, the AP's variance estimator of client carrier frequency offset significantly increases when there are jamming signals present. We build a test bed with a 72-antenna AP and collect over 3 000 000 over-the-air transmissions. Our results show that a single-antenna adversary jamming no more than 1/60 of the time and having no more transmit power than any client can cause over 23% reduction of achievable rate of all clients. Moreover, by setting a single detection threshold, MACE can achieve 0.97 true positive at 0.01 false positive for various client/adversary locations and for a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) (5 35 dB) and signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) (-5 35 dB) with SNR - SIR \geq5 dB. © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Damped sinusoidal signals occur in many fields of science and practical issues. One of them are adaptive optics systems where such signals are undesirable and often diminish the system performance. One of solutions to reject these signals is a method called AVC which is based on the estimation of vibrations parameters. In recent years, an universal, fast and accurate estimation method has been presented. It can be used to estimate multifrequency signals and can be useful in many various cases where the estimation method plays a crucial role. The main idea of this paper is using it in the AVC method to increase the system performance. There can be distinguished several measurement parameters that affect the accuracy and the speed of the estimation method: CiR (number of signal cycles in the estimation process), N (number of signal samples in a measurement window), H (time window order). There are also parameters that are especially important in practical situations (damped signals with noise and harmonics): SNR, THD, γ (changed in time a damping ratio). Total estimation errors consist of systematic errors and random errors. This paper is focusing on the second component, i.e. when the signal with γ ≠ 0 is distorted by noise. Results can be very useful from a practical point of view because they give information about the estimation accuracy in dependence of noise power for various damping ratio values. The value of the empirical MSE of the frequency estimator is approximately 10Λ-3 Hz for SNR = 30 dB H = 2 and γ = 0.01%. © 2018 SPIE.},

A crucial issue in implementing these filters is the accurate estimation of the grid voltage phase/frequency. Indeed, the dynamic behavior and the performance of the SAPF strongly rely on this point. To deal with this challenge, a fast yet effective open-loop synchronization (OLS) technique based on Cascaded Delayed Signal Cancellation (CDSC) is presented in this paper. The proposed technique can reject the odd-order harmonics, the DC offset of the grid voltage, and its dynamic response during transients take an only half cycle of the fundamental frequency. To adapt the proposed OLS technique to the frequency changes, an efficient frequency estimator is also presented. The effectiveness of the proposed OLS technique is demonstrated using simulation and experimental results. © 2013 IEEE.},

Regardless of the type of the Condition Monitoring System (stationary, remote, wireless) and the system’s manufacturer, the most commonly applied Health Indicators include wideband estimators (peak-to-peak, Root Mean Square, kurtosis, crest factor, velocity Root Mean Square), narrowband estimators (speed harmonics, gear meshing frequencies, rolling-element bearing characteristic frequen-cies), and simple spectral bands corresponding to a group of machine elements, e.g. 100–2000 Hz for gearboxes. In order to improve the reliability of Health Indicators, stationary Condition Monitoring System implement averaging and advanced data acquisition logic. In order to detect faults in very early stage, Condition Monitoring System implement resampling, order analysis, Deterministic Random Separation, and for instance auxiliary visualization. However, in case of wireless Condition Monitoring System without a speed sensor, improvement might concern only three aspect, namely hardware realization, data transmission, and power savings, where the latter one might be decomposed into data transfer power consumption, data acquisition power consumption, and data analysis power consumption. The current paper illustrates few recent ideas on how to minimize the power consumptions for data analysis. As it will be shown, it is possible to reduce the computational cycles by more than 60% comparing to stationary Condition Monitoring System while losing acceptable level of the quality of calculated Health Indicators. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.},

However, the traditional methods rely on the periodic communication, which is neither economic nor efficient due to its large communication burden. In this paper, an event-triggered-approach-based distributed control strategy is used to deal with the secondary frequency and voltage control in the islanded microgrid. By using the outputs of estimators, which are reset to the actual values only at the event-triggered time, to replace the actual values in the feedback control laws, the proposed control strategies just require the communication between distributed secondary controllers at some particular instants while having frequency and voltage restoration function and accurate active power sharing. The stability and interevent interval are also analyzed in this paper. An islanded microgrid test system is built in PSCAD/EMTDC to validate the proposed control strategies. It shows that the proposed secondary control strategies based on the event-triggered approach can highly reduce the interagent communication. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Frequency variations are much faster and more significant in microgrids with low-inertia inverters and other control devices for distributed generation. Accordingly, it is imperative to utilize a concise frequency estimation method for analyzing the transient behavior of microgrids. This paper proposes a robust algorithm which is based on multi-resonator and adaptive notch filter and is referred to as the multi-resonant notch frequency control for improving the frequency estimation of perturbed power system. In general, power system distortions such as harmonics, inter-harmonics, and faults may affect the accuracy of frequency estimation. In contrast to conventional methods for frequency estimator, the proposed method is less sensitive to distortions and unbalanced power system conditions. The proposed method uses the information in all three-phase signals which is proved to be more robust against signal variations than single-phase methods. Simulation results demonstrate the accuracy and the speed of the proposed method for frequency estimation in both grid-connected and islanded mode of low inertia microgrids under grid faults. © 2010-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In recent days, there has been a growing interest in network-on-chip (NoC), as it offers a promising architecture for future systems on-chip (SoC). The performance degradation is the major problem in designing NoC, due to the complexity in designing a traffic generator and traffic estimator (TE) modules. In the conventional NoC design, new traffic modules and low-power algorithms (LPAS) are introduced. A LPA with an NoC has given performance degradation in the transmission rate, end-to-end delay and overall energy consumption. To address this power issue, we modeled the Menger's theorem (MT) (graph theory (GT))-based clock boosting mechanism to produce an effective frequency for the router. The following two methods are introduced to improve the performance of NoCs: (i) development of a real-time traffic generation module and software-based traffic estimator (STE) (ii) GT approach is introduced into a dynamic frequency scaling (DFS) LPA. In general, the frequency selection process during various traffic conditions in history-based dynamic voltage scaling algorithm (HDVS) and history-based DFS algorithm (HDFS) is more complex and it gives performance degradation. In the proposed method, MT-based DFS (MT-DFS) parameters are estimated under various conditions using both 65 and 90nm TSMC CMOS technology. In comparison with conventional HDFS, the evaluations show that MT-DFS interface achieves 67.7% energy saving, 85% dynamic power savings of the links in the on-chip network and 74.27% leakage power saving of the link. © 2018 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

	abstract = {Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are naturally highly interconnected and complexly nonlinear. This paper investigates the problem of decentralized adaptive output feedback control for CPSs subject to intermittent denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. The considered CPSs are modeled as a class of nonlinear uncertain strict-feedback interconnected systems. When a DoS attack is active, all the state variables become unavailable and standard backstepping cannot be applied. To overcome this difficulty, a switching-type adaptive state estimator is constructed. Based on an improved average dwell time method incorporated by frequency and duration properties of DoS attacks, convex design conditions of controller parameters are derived in term of solving a set of linear matrix inequalities. The proposed controller guarantees that all closed-loop signals remain bounded, while the error signals converge to a small neighborhood of the origin. As an illustrative example, the proposed control scheme is applied to a power network system. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Regulation of heart rate variability (HRV) is dependent on the autonomic nervous system (ANS). The regulation is achieved by the two ANS activity branches distribution, namely the parasympathetic and the sympathetic activities. Their fluctuations can be observed in the HRV signal spectral domain through respective dissociated frequency domains. Power spectrum parameters in low frequency (LF) and high frequency (HF) domains are classically estimated using predetermined fixed frequency ranges which are [0.04–0.15 Hz] band for LF domain and [0.15–0.4 Hz] band for HF domain. However, the 0.15 Hz frequency threshold is controversial in dynamic situations or positions changing. Several studies advanced that the observed cardiac and respiratory oscillation interactions could reflect the functionality of the ANS. These interactions can be estimated by the cardiorespiratory spectral coherence tool which quantifies the existence and strength of linearity between the two modes. We propose in this paper to jointly use the heart rate variability (HRV) and respiration modes by exploiting the cardiorespiratory spectral coherence tool for the time-varying frequency threshold definition between LF and HF bands. The instantaneous center frequency computed on the time-frequency coherence estimator is the proposed variable threshold (VT). The VT method was implemented on both simulated data and real data acquired from the experimental orthostatic test protocol with 10 healthy subjects. The classical 0.15 Hz fixed threshold (FT) and the individual time-dependent spectral boundaries method (AT) using the lower limit of the respiratory HF band as a time-varying threshold are used for comparison. The proposed VT strategy makes it possible to obtain: (i) a strengthened data-dependent definition of boundaries for the HF domain; (ii) instantaneous estimations of the LF and HF band energies; (iii) a better discrimination between the two positions SUPINE and UPRIGHT of the classical orthostatic test. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is a breakthrough technology equipped with a large number of antennas and radio frequency (RF) chains, which increases complexity and circuit power consumption at the RF front-ends. Power utilisation of analog-to-digital converters is a major concern in RF chains, so one-bit massive MIMO systems are seen as one of the potential solutions to this problem. Further, channel state information (CSI) accuracy at the base station is one of the crucial needs for realising the benefits of one-bit massive MIMO. The existing pilot based estimators demand additional pilots for enhancing the CSI accuracy which in turn reduces the spectral efficiency of the system. To address this limitation, we propose an iterative semi-blind based channel estimator for one-bit massive MIMO systems in a pilot contaminated scenario. The proposed algorithm consists of two stages namely, initialisation and iteration. The initial channel estimate is obtained from pilot based initialisation stage, which is further refined in iteration stage with the help of both pilot and a few data symbols. The proposed semi-blind algorithm improves estimation accuracy with minimum number of pilot symbols. Through simulations, we show that the proposed scheme achieves a considerable improvement in mean square error and bit error rate against the existing pilot based estimators at the cost of a nominal increase in computational complexity. Moreover, the proposed algorithm attains convergence in two iterations for all the considered scenarios. The proposed estimator is spectral and power-efficient in comparison to the pilot based algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first attempt of channel estimation in pilot contaminated one-bit massive MIMO systems. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {A brain–computer interface (BCI) is a channel of communication that transforms brain activity into specific commands for manipulating a personal computer or other home or electrical devices. In other words, a BCI is an alternative way of interacting with the environment by using brain activity instead of muscles and nerves. For that reason, BCI systems are of high clinical value for targeted populations suffering from neurological disorders. In this paper, we present a new processing approach in three publicly available BCI data sets: (a) a well-known multi-class (N = 6) coded-modulated Visual Evoked potential (c-VEP)-based BCI system for able-bodied and disabled subjects; (b) a multi-class (N = 32) c-VEP with slow and fast stimulus representation; and (c) a steady-state Visual Evoked potential (SSVEP) multi-class (N = 5) flickering BCI system. Estimating cross-frequency coupling (CFC) and namely δ-θ [δ: (0.5–4 Hz), θ: (4–8 Hz)] phase-to-amplitude coupling (PAC) within sensor and across experimental time, we succeeded in achieving high classification accuracy and Information Transfer Rates (ITR) in the three data sets. Our approach outperformed the originally presented ITR on the three data sets. The bit rates obtained for both the disabled and able-bodied subjects reached the fastest reported level of 324 bits/min with the PAC estimator. Additionally, our approach outperformed alternative signal features such as the relative power (29.73 bits/min) and raw time series analysis (24.93 bits/min) and also the original reported bit rates of 10–25 bits/min. In the second data set, we succeeded in achieving an average ITR of 124.40 ± 11.68 for the slow 60 Hz and an average ITR of 233.99 ± 15.75 for the fast 120 Hz. In the third data set, we succeeded in achieving an average ITR of 106.44 ± 8.94. Current methodology outperforms any previous methodologies applied to each of the three free available BCI datasets. © 2018 Dimitriadis and Marimpis.},

	abstract = {This study develops and compares several networked control and estimation algorithms to manipulate the power consumption of a population of residential thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs) to fulfill PJM frequency regulation requests given an imperfect communication network and modeling error. The algorithms rely on a model of the plant to reduce the effects of communication delays, and include a stochastic, predictive controller and two Kalman filter-based state estimation techniques. The first estimator uses a set of independent Kalman filters that run in parallel, and the second incorporates individual TCL models that rely on identified thermal parameters. We use simulations to examine 1) the algorithms' ability to adequately provide frequency regulation under a range of delay severities, and 2) the effect of increased modeling error. We find that both estimator-controller combinations provide acceptable frequency regulation with average delays of 20 s and minor modeling error. When we increase the modeling error by using a higher order model to represent the TCLs within the plant, the first estimator provides acceptable frequency regulation, whereas the second estimator provides poor frequency regulation. © 1969-2012 IEEE.},

The in-phase and quadrature (IQ) imbalance is an important factor degrading the transmitter error vector magnitude (EVM), thus limiting the transmitter performance. In order to compensate for the IQ imbalance, a feedback path at the transmitter output is needed to estimate the mismatch. The analog-to-digital converter (ADC) in the feedback path can be power hungry when the signal bandwidth is large. In this paper, we propose a digital IQ imbalance estimator and compensator with 1-bit quantization in the feedback path.

	abstract = {Human cognitive state classification using Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal is one of the dynamic exploring regions in emerging smart machine systems. It motivates to build estimator for revealing the human cognitive behaviours for different environments. In this work, we present an operational human cognitive behaviour detection system based on ambulatory EEG signal analysis. A novel event driven environment is created using external stimuli to collect those signals. They are captured using 14 channel Emotiv neuro-headset. Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) is a very popular feature extraction method in acoustic signal processing. In spite of it’s popularity, it has not been explored much when it comes to EEG signals. This paper proposes a novel technique of applying MFCC feature extraction method for ambulatory EEG signals and the results are found to be promising. Besides other feature extraction methods such as: Power Spectral Density (PSD), Discrete Wavelet Transformation (DWT) are used to extract intrinsic features from EEG signal. A statistical technique, Fisher Discriminant Ratio (FDR) is applied on them to evaluate the robustness of each feature. A higher FDR value is observed from MFCC features which demonstrate its discriminative power during classification. Different machine learning techniques such as Probabilistic neural network (P-NN), k-nearest neighbor (kNN), multi-class support vector machine (MCSVM) are applied for training, testing and validating the extracted features. A comparative analysis is discussed for each classifier coupled with each feature. It is found that P-NN with MFCC feature produces the maximum accuracy of 92.61% amongst all the remaining classifiers. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

	abstract = {Distribution-level signals are often contaminated with harmonics and noise, along with dynamic conditions like frequency deviations. This paper proposes an empirical wavelet transform (EWT) based M-class distribution-level phasor estimation technique under such polluted and dynamic conditions. The capability of the EWT of extracting different frequency components present in the signal makes it suitable for distribution-level phasor estimation. However, the empirical wavelet filters are designed on the basis of the Fourier spectrum of the signal, which, inturn suffers from a spectral leakage problem at off-nominal frequencies. To avoid the errors arising due to spectral leakage, a sample value adjustment based prefiltering technique is employed. The effectiveness of the proposed estimator is demonstrated on various simulated signals, field-data, and real-time signals obtained from the hardware implementation setup. The proposed algorithm is found to be least affected by the presence of dc components, harmonics, and noise. The use of a fixed window size and fixed sampling frequency makes it suitable for synchronization with GPS clocks. The proposed scheme is also able to provide an accurate harmonic phasor estimation. © 1982-2012 IEEE.},

The features in the degradation process of a battery are conveniently measured by a group of current pulses, which last only few seconds. The proposed evolutionary framework selects the most efficient combination of the short-term features from the current pulse test, and guarantees an optimal training process simultaneously. A hybrid encoding technology is applied to mix the feature extraction and the parameters of support vector regression in one chromosome. With the benefit of the proposed evolutionary framework, the battery state of health is estimated by using support vector regression and genetic algorithm in a more efficient way.

	abstract = {Accurate detection of the system parameters in unbalanced three-phase power systems is a prerequisite for the optimal operation and control of future smart grids. However, theoretical and practical performance bounds of various estimators for unbalanced systems are only just being established. To this end, we introduce the appropriate Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) for frequency estimation, based on the α β -transformed unbalanced voltage contaminated with noise. Next, for rigor, the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method for frequency estimation is introduced as a maximizer of an 'augmented periodogram.' The underlying augmented complex statistics is shown to cater for all the available second-order information, including the noncircularity associated with unbalanced systems. To find the ML solution, Newton's iterative method is employed and its initialization is implemented by a discrete Fourier transform-based dichotomous search technique. We show that the MLE of phases and amplitudes of both the positive and negative phase-sequence components within the α β -transformed voltage can be generically derived based on the ML frequency estimates. In this way, a unified framework is provided to accurately detect voltage characteristics of the positive and negative phase-sequence components within an unbalanced three-phase power system when its frequency experiences off-nominal conditions. Simulations verify that the proposed MLE approaches theoretical CRLBs for all parameters under consideration. © 2018 IEEE.},

The ETC aims to reduce communication requirements, thereby enabling control of large scale systems.

Therefore, the present work aimed at developing an early warning system for electrical distribution substations by predicting insulation breakdown. This paper, focused on time delay estimation in between the UHF signals received at multiple sensors placed around the substation. The delay estimation is most critical and essential part in detection and localization of electrical component having weakness or some defects in insulation and act as PD source. Unfortunately, the radiated UHF signals are highly contaminated with noise, form mobile, TV, and Radio broadcastings. Previous works on time delay estimation in the area mainly depends on time domain based estimation procedures, such as first peak (FP), cumulative energy (CE), and cross correlation (CC). However, recent study reveals that, each PD sources having less variant and almost unique frequency domain based signature. Therefore, in the work, Generalized Cross Correlation (GCC) which is a frequency domain based correlation technique for estimation of time delay has been investigated in details. In the work different weighing functions for the GCC, such as Smoothed Coherence Transform (SCOT), the Phase Transform (PHAT), the Eckart Filter (EF) and the Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimator. The study reveals that the GCC with ML function provide most accurate and precise estimation of time delay. © 2018 IEEE.},

The sampling frequency offset playing a major role in the degradation of the link performance, various solutions have been proposed to cope with this effect. The objective of this paper is to present a simple blind estimation of the offset, calculated on each OFDM symbol and thus only based on the received data. A correction is then applied on the phase of the received signal. Synchronization of the receiver with a phased-locked loop is not treated in this paper. After illustrating this approach for an additional white Gaussian noise channel, a power line communication in an aircraft is envisaged. The architecture of the network is described and a parametric study is carried out to assess the performance of the proposed offset estimator and the phase correction technique.

Therefore, a dynamic synchrophasor estimator was proposed based on multi-frequency phasor model. The multi-frequency phasor model was employed to reflect the effective information around real frequency, and to establish a phasor model including multi-frequency phasor. The accuracy phasor value could be obtained by estimating rough frequency, looking the matrix table calculated offline, revising the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) value and shifting phasor. Test results of both simulated signals and PSCAD/EMTDC generated signal show that the proposed estimator can provide accurate phasor estimations under dynamic conditions of frequency ramping and power oscillation at the cost of limited increase of computational burden. © 2018 Chin.

The classical moment-based method has been successfully used to estimate the K-factor from time series measurements. In this paper, we apply this method to estimate the K-factor for narrowband temporal selectivity, based upon the analysis of frequency-selectivity in single-snapshot wideband measurements. We also derive the theoretical bias of this estimator and find it depends jointly on the number of channel transfer function envelope samples across the measurement bandwidth, the correlation among such samples, and the K-factor values. Qualitative analysis indicates that the bias increases nearly linearly with the K-factor (K≥q 1 on the linear scale) and is affected by correlation amongst the samples. Furthermore, the bias is inversely proportional to the number of samples. Simulations confirm the validity of the derivations. Moreover, a measurement campaign is designed at 28 GHz with a system bandwidth of 400 MHz in an urban micro-cell scenario. The proposed estimator is used to extract the statistics of the K-factor in line of sight and non-line of sight scenarios. The relationship between the K-factor and distance is investigated and a linear model is used to characterize it. © 1967-2012 IEEE.},

The purpose is to evaluate the energy penalties of the flight control actuation system as an aircraft manoeuvre along any arbitrary trajectory. The advantage is that the approximations include major transient properties which previous steady state techniques could not capture. The output can be used to provide feedback to a trajectory optimisation process to help it compute the aircraft level optimality of any given flight path. The tool features a six degree of freedom dynamic model of an aircraft which is combined with low frequency functional electro-mechanical actuator models in order to estimate the major transient power demands. The actuator models interact with the aircraft using an aerodynamic load estimator which generates load forces on the actuators that vary as a function of flight condition and control surface demands. A total energy control system is applied for longitudinal control and a total heading control system is implemented to manage the lateral motion. The outer loop is closed using a simple waypoint following guidance system with turn anticipation and variable turn radius control. To test the model, a simple trajectory analysis is undertaken which quantifies a heading change executed with four different turn rates. The tool shows that the actuation system requires 12.8 times more electrical energy when performing a 90° turn with a radius of 400 m compared to 1000 m. A second test is performed to verify the model’s ability to track a longer trajectory under windy conditions. © IMechE 2017.},

To gain appreciable success in the elimination of these two challenges, this paper advances a SR framework employing KF in the frequency domain, while no resort is made to any approximations or extra assumptions in the dynamic system modeling and statistical matrices. Generally, previous KF-based SR methods organized the system with huge-sized matrices in the spatial domain, following which they tried to reduce the system dimension using approximation and/or limitation on point spread function (PSF). In this study, first, several small-dimension dynamic systems are separately made in the frequency domain supporting space-invariant PSFs of an arbitrary form and size. Then, the acquired small-dimension KF estimators are applied rather than the traditional huge-dimension one. These will greatly reduce computational complexity, decrease storage requirements allowing parallel implementation as well. Furthermore, our proposed SR framework can be used to produce high resolution image of an expedient size, that is, a scalable SR. Experimental results with both simulated and real world sequences indicate that our proposed framework works more effectively than the other compared methods, especially in fine details restoration. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

The calculation of the first state is sufficient to identify the fundamental components of the current, voltage and angle. Therefore, the Kalman state estimator is fast and simple. A Kalman based control strategy is proposed and implemented for a UPQC in a distribution system. The performance of the proposed control strategy is assessed for all possible source conditions with varying nonlinear and linear loads. The functioning of the proposed control algorithm with a UPQC is scrutinized and validated through simulations employing MATLAB/Simulink software. Using a FPGA SPATRAN 3A DSP board, the proposed algorithm is developed and implemented. A small-scale laboratory prototype is built to verify the simulation results. The stated control scheme for the UPQC reduces the following issues, voltage sags, voltage swells, harmonic distortions (voltage and current), unbalanced supply voltage and unbalanced power factor under dynamic and steady-state operating conditions. © 2018, Korean Institute of Power Electronics.

	abstract = {Phasor measurement units (PMUs) have become powerful monitoring tools for many applications in smart grids. In order to address the different issues related to harmonics in power systems, the fundamental phasor estimator in a PMU has been extended to the harmonic phasor estimator by several researchers around the world. Yet, the development of harmonic phasor estimators is a challenge because they have to consider time-varying frequencies since the frequency deviation in the harmonic components is proportional to the harmonic order in a dynamic way. In this work, a new algorithm for harmonic phasor estimation using an instantaneous single-sideband (SSB) modulation is presented. Unlike other SSB-based approaches, its implementation in this work is based on concepts of instantaneous phase and instantaneous frequency. In general, the proposed algorithm is divided into two stages. Firstly, the estimation of the fundamental phasor is carried out by means of a complex finite impulse response (FIR) filter which provides the analytic signal used to compute the instantaneous magnitude, phase, and frequency. Secondly, a complex FIR filter bank is proposed for the estimation of the harmonic components, where the instantaneous SSB modulation technique is applied in order to center the harmonic components into specific narrow bands for each complex filter when an off-nominal frequency occurs. The validation of the proposed algorithm is carried out by means of the current standards of phasor measurement units, i.e., Std. C37.118.1-2011 and C37.118.1a-2014, which involve steady-state, dynamic, and time performance tests. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

The algorithm consists of a robust low frequency estimator and a notch filter in parallel. The asymptotical convergence property is analyzed by slow integral manifold, averaging method, and Lyapunov stability theorem sequentially. The steady-state antinoise property is investigated by perturbed system theorem. The robust advantages of the proposed algorithm are embodied in the following aspects: the fundamental amplitude identification is little influenced by oscillation frequency and oscillation amplitude, both oscillation frequency identification and oscillation amplitude identification have small steady-state errors under high order harmonics or bounded noises, the ramp variations of both fundamental amplitude and oscillation amplitude are also significantly tracked, and three design parameters have different effects on identification performance of oscillation frequency, oscillation amplitude, and fundamental amplitude, respectively. Simulation results verify the validity. © 2019 Zhaobi Chu et al.},

	abstract = {Harmonics estimation during transients (e.g. caused by power quality events such as dips and swells) is a well-known, although less explored measurement problem in power systems, which deserves greater attention due to the changeable operating conditions of future smart grids. The classic frequency-domain harmonics estimator in nonstationary conditions is the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT). In this paper, the results achieved with this technique to estimate the amplitude of time-varying harmonics are compared with those returned by an extended version of the so-called Interpolated Dynamic Discrete Fourier Transform (IpD2FT), which in principle is more suitable to track phasor variations over time. Several simulation results show indeed that the IpD2FT exhibits better responsiveness and it is more accurate than the STFT in estimating the fundamental and odd-order harmonics. On the contrary, for weak even-order harmonics the STFT looks preferable. This scenario suggests that both techniques could be advantageously used together. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Grid-tied inverters are widely used in the modern power network. The span of their applications varies from power quality enhancement, uninterruptible power supply, grid interface to distributed energy sources, etc. A major aspect of controlling the grid-tied power converter is the synchronization with the main grid. A robust synchronization method is required to maintain the power injection during grid fault and highly distorted grid voltage. This paper introduces a novel Pseudo-Open Loop Synchronization Technique (POLS) based on a fixed reference frame estimator: the Fundamental Positive Components Estimator (PFCE). The algorithm will generate three unitary sinus waveform synchronized with the fundamental positive component of a three-phase grid voltage. Open Loop Synchronization (OLS) technique differs from the closed loop PLL in that it has a faster dynamics response. Two problems may face the OLS: a low-quality main voltage and frequency drift. To face the voltage quality problem, the PFCE is used. This choice is advantageous over the use of a low-pass filter due to the absence of the time delay and filtering performances. For the frequency drift, an optional simple frequency estimator is used. No trigonometric computation is required for the proposed algorithm, making it easy to implement on a low-cost microcontroller. The performances and effectiveness of the proposed method are demonstrated through simulation and experimental results. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

In this study, six popular parameter estimation methods are reviewed and compared with a new method that we call Modified Energy Pattern Factor (MEPF) method. The advantage of MEPF is that it is free from binning, linear least square problems or iterative procedures. All methods are compared via a thorough Monte Carlo simulation study with sample sizes varying from 100 to 100,000. The results indicate that the MEPF is a suitable alternative and comparable with the relatively best estimator of the Weibull parameters at each sample size. Consequently, we have used the MEPF to estimate the Weibull parameters of wind data from three regions in India, and we explain how to use these insights for the calculation and prediction of wind energy production. In particular, for harnessing the wind energy, both wind speed and direction are important. For the wind direction assessment, we have compared the conventional von Mises distribution to the new 4-parameter Kato-Jones distribution, and found that the latter approach provides better results. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

First, transfer functions for power converter, current estimator and current mode controller are given for frequency-domain analysis. Second, without consideration of parasitics, conventional proportional integral compensation is used to improve the system stability. Furthermore, with consideration of parasitics, converter main pole is replaced by two poles while a zero emerges at the origin. In order to cancel out the influence, the proposed CFCP strategy adopts a second-order transfer function to correct zero/pole variation induced by parasitics.

	abstract = {This paper proposes a fast and robust unscented Kalman filter based decentralized dynamic state estimator (DSE) for power system online monitoring and control. The proposed robust DSE is able to detect, identify, and suppress three types of outliers, namely the observation, innovation, and structural outliers. Observation outliers refer to the received PMU measurements providing unreliable metered values due to gross errors or cyber attacks; innovation outliers are typically caused by impulsive system process noise, whereas structural outliers are induced by incorrect parameters of the generators or its associated controllers, such as exciters and speed governors. To enable the fast estimation of generator states of large-scale power systems in a decentralized manner, two model decoupling approaches are presented and compared. It is shown that the generator decoupling approach presented in this paper achieves higher statistical efficiency than the ones proposed in the literature in the presence of both small and large measurement noise. To detect and distinguish three types of outliers, projection statistics based multiple hypothesis testing approach is proposed. Specifically, three hypotheses corresponding to the occurrence of three types of outliers are assumed by constructing three innovation matrices; these matrices are made up by time-correlated innovation vectors, and/or predicted states, and/or measurements; then projection statistics are applied to each of the innovation matrix and its calculated projection values are checked by a statistical test to validate the assumed hypothesis.

	abstract = {Wireless body area networks (WBANs) comprise several sensor nodes equipped with a short range radio-frequency transceiver, implanted and/or attached to the human body. Their low form-factor and localization imply less resources available and limited energy capabilities. Therefore, energy efficiency of WBANs is a critical issue since, in many cases, batteries cannot be replaced or recharged, requiring mechanisms to extend their lifetime. The aim of transmission power control (TPC) mechanisms, which can be combined with other energy-saving mechanisms, is to reduce the energy consumption, external interferences, and specific-observation-rate in wireless communications by dynamically adjusting the transmission power output of data transmission, with the minimum effect on other performance aspects, such as reliability and latency. This paper describes and analyzes the TPCs developed as a result of a synergy created by two mechanisms, a link quality estimator and the transmission power level control. Design choices, in terms of the solutions devised to each mechanism, as well as, the strategy adopted to combine them in a TPC, are highlighted. A comparison between the newest and the most relevant research works in this area is provided as a guideline to future research. A taxonomy to classify the different TPC mechanisms developed is proposed. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The adaptive Goldstein filter driven by InSAR coherence is one of the most famous frequency domain-based filters and has been widely used to improve the quality of InSAR measurement with different noise features. However, the filtering power is biased to varying degrees due to the biased coherence estimator and empirical modelling of the filtering power under a given coherence level. This leads to under- or over-estimation of phase noise over the entire dataset. Here, the authors present a method to correct filtering power on the basis of the second kind statistical coherence estimator. In contrast with regular statistics, the new estimator has smaller bias and variance values, and therefore provides more accurate coherence observations. In addition, a piece-wise function model determined from the Monte Carlo simulation is used to compensate for the nonlinear relationship between the filtering parameter and coherence. This method was tested on both synthetic and real data sets and the results were compared against those derived from other state-of-the-art filters. The better performance of the new filter for edge preservation and residue reduction demonstrates the value of this method. © 2018 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In recent years, several frequency estimation techniques have been proposed by which to estimate the frequency variations in power systems. In order to properly identify power quality issues under asynchronously-sampled signals that are contaminated with noise, flicker, and harmonic and inter-harmonic components, a good frequency estimator that is able to estimate the frequency as well as the rate of frequency changes precisely is needed. However, accurately estimating the fundamental frequency becomes a very difficult task without a priori information about the sampling frequency. In this paper, a better frequency evaluation scheme for power systems is proposed. This method employs a reconstruction technique in combination with orthogonal filters, which may maintain the required frequency characteristics of the orthogonal filters and improve the overall efficiency of power system monitoring through two-stage sliding discrete Fourier transforms. The results showed that this method can accurately estimate the power system frequency under different conditions, including asynchronously sampled signals contaminated by noise, flicker, and harmonic and inter-harmonic components. The proposed approach also provides high computational efficiency. © 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Unlike other stochastic converters, this proposed architecture does not require an inverse Gaussian cumulative density function estimator. The digital adder becomes an ideal estimator due to uncorrelated quantization errors, which can be modeled as a uniformly distributed random variable. Because of the simple open-loop structure, this stochastic converter can easily be synthesized and reconfigured. The proof-of-concept prototype is implemented in a 0.18 CMOS process. The prototype employs eight VCO-based quantizers and validates the extra 9 dB signal to quantization noise ratio improvement from quantization error spatial averaging.

	abstract = {Wiener filtering is an important operation in vibration analysis of mechanical systems. It consists on estimating the linear-time-invariant filter that, when convolved with the signal, gives an optimal estimate of a signal of interest in the least mean square sense. This paper addresses the estimation of the Wiener filter in the case where the signal of interest is a vibratory contribution generated by a mechanical source. For this purpose, the paper starts by proposing the concept of mono-source cyclostationarity, before establishing a valuable link between the Wiener filter and the cyclic power spectra of the signal associated with the cyclic frequency set of the source of interest. Based on this relation, two estimators are proposed and their performances are compared through simulations. Last, the efficiency of the proposed approach is demonstrated on a real vibration signal captured from a helicopter gearbox and compared with the classical spectral kurtosis.

In addition, The MPC technique is designed such that the effect of the load disturbance is reduced. The full model parameters of the system have been estimated using online estimation model based on Recursive Polynomial Model Estimator (RPME). Moreover, the output of the RPME estimator is used to online updating of the internal model of the AMPC. The online estimation is to achieve accurate and precise control with nonlinear control systems. A digital simulation has been used to investigate the effecinecy of the proposed scheme.

	abstract = {Massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) uses a large number of antennas and radio frequency (RF) chains which incur a huge cost and power consumption. Since high-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) consumes a major portion of the RF chain circuit power, so one-bit massive MIMO systems are seen as one of the potential solutions to reduce the power consumption and cost associated with the RF chains. Our paper addresses channel estimation issue which is among one of the crucial needs for the practical realization of one-bit massive MIMO systems. The pilot-aided channel estimator demands additional pilots to improve the estimation accuracy which in turn reduces the spectral efficiency of the system. To overcome this, we propose an iterative semi-blind based channel estimator for one-bit massive MIMO systems. The proposed algorithm consists of two stages: initialization and iteration. The initial channel estimate is obtained from the pilot based initialization stage, which is refined further in the iteration stage with the help of both pilot and few data symbols. So, the semi-blind estimator improves estimation accuracy without the addition of extra pilot symbols into the system. Through simulations, we show that the proposed scheme achieves significant improvement against the existing pilot based estimators in terms of estimation accuracy and bit error rate (BER) at the cost of a nominal increase in the computational complexity. Further, the proposed algorithm attains convergence in almost one iteration for all the considered scenarios of one-bit massive MIMO system. Thus, the semi-blind estimator is spectral and power efficient in comparison to the existing pilot based algorithms. © 2018 IEEE.},

In order to guarantees the inverter operation with a wide range of grid parameters, the damping and the controller gains are designed considering robustness characteristics. Moreover, it proposes a new estimator for the current filter capacitor for operation with a wide range filter resonance frequency.

	abstract = {In the frequency domain modeling of power supplying networks, it is usually necessary to determine the frequency spectrum of the currents flowing through the nonlinear devices (Arrillaga and Watson, 2003; Das, 2015; Lewandowski and Walczak, 2014). The spectrum estimation can be done in many different ways (Lewandowski and Walczak, 2014; Łobos and Rezmer, 1997; Ray et al., 2016). In work (Lewandowski and Walczak, 2014) a spectrum estimation method has been proposed, which has better accuracy in comparison with other competitive methods like WIFTA (Window Interpolated Fourier Transform) or TDQS (Time Domain Quasi-Synchronous Sampling), while maintaining a low demand for computing power. The accuracy of this method depends on two main factors: the accuracy of the fundamental frequency estimation and the accuracy of the signal interpolation in the resampling process. For the estimation of the fundamental frequency, the method uses a first order Prony's estimator (Łobos and Rezmer, 1997) and a band-pass FIR (Finite Impulse Response) filter. In the paper, an attempt was made to find the optimal parameters for both: the Prony's estimator and the FIR filter. First, an analysis of the measurement window size of the Prony's estimator and the number of the FIR filter coefficients was performed. Then, the optimization problem was defined, which is not trivial, since the Prony's estimator is highly nonlinear and some of the parameters (the window size and the number of filter coefficients) are integers. The research allowed to determine the optimal values of the considered parameters of the frequency estimation method. Along with the results presented in Lewandowski and Walczak (2015) it is now possible to implement the spectrum estimation method from Lewandowski and Walczak (2014) using the optimal set of parameters. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

Error measures and an automated procedure for covariance driven Operational Modal Analysis (OMA) techniques has been proposed with a particular focus on damping estimation of wind turbine towers. In the design of offshore structures the estimates of damping are crucial for tuning of the numerical model. The errors of damping estimates are evaluated from simulated tower response of an aeroelastic model of an 8 MW offshore wind turbine. In order to obtain algorithmic independent answers, three identification techniques are compared: Eigensystem Realization Algorithm (ERA), covariance driven Stochastic Subspace Identification (COV-SSI) and the Enhanced Frequency Domain Decomposition (EFDD). Discrepancies between automated identification techniques are discussed and illustrated with respect to signal noise, measurement time, vibration amplitudes and stationarity of the ambient response. The best bias-variance error trade-off of damping estimates is obtained by the COV-SSI. The proposed automated procedure is validated by real vibration measurements of an offshore wind turbine in non-operating conditions from a 24-h monitoring period. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a cardiovascular disease associated with autonomic dysfunction, where sympathovagal imbalance was reported in many studies using heart rate variability (HRV). To learn more about the dynamic interaction in the autonomic nervous system (ANS), we explored the directed interaction between the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) with the help of transfer entropy (TE). This article included 24-h RR interval signals of 54 healthy subjects (31 males and 23 females, 61.38 ± 11.63 years old) and 44 CHF subjects (8 males and 2 females, 19 subjects' gender were unknown, 55.51 ± 11.44 years old, 4 in class I, 8 in class II and 32 in class III~IV, according to the New York Heart Association Function Classification), obtained from the PhysioNet database and then segmented into 5-min non-overlapping epochs using cubic spline interpolation. For each segment in the normal group and CHF group, frequency-domain features included low-frequency (LF) power, high-frequency (HF) power and LF/HF ratio were extracted as classical estimators of autonomic activity. In the nonlinear domain, TE between LF and HF were calculated to quantify the information exchanging between SNS and PNS. Compared with the normal group, an extreme decrease in LF/HF ratio (p = 0.000) and extreme increases in both TE(LF→HF) (p = 0.000) and TE(HF→LF) (p = 0.000) in the CHF group were observed. Moreover, both in normal and CHF groups, TE(LF→HF) was a lot greater than TE(HF→LF) (p = 0.000), revealing that TE was able to distinguish the difference in the amount of directed information transfer among ANS. Extracted features were further applied in discriminating CHF using IBM SPSS Statistics discriminant analysis. The combination of the LF/HF ratio, TE(LF→HF) and TE(HF→LF) reached the highest screening accuracy (83.7%). Our results suggested that TE could serve as a complement to traditional index LF/HF in CHF screening. © 2018 by the authors.},

However, dialysis access stenosis and further dysfunction are engendered by thrombosis or outflow (venous anastomosis site) stenosis and the progression of inflow (arterial anastomosis site) stenosis. Thus, any narrowed access causes vibrations, turbulent flow, and murmur sounds around stenosis sites. Auscultation and frequency-based techniques are employed to detect these sounds, and frequency components are also validated on the basis of the degree of stenosis (DOS). In this paper, a biophysical experimental model employing an in vitro arteriovenous graft model was established to produce various acoustic signals associated with single stenosis and multiple stenoses. By analyzing various combinations of stenoses, this paper selected suitable features of the frequency and power spectra using the Burg autoregressive method. A multiple regression model applying a higher number of explanatory variables and response variables, as a generalized regression neural network, was employed to identify DOS levels at inflow and outflow sites. The experimental results indicated that the proposed screening model provided a higher average hit rate of >90%, average true-positive rate of >90%, and true-negative rate of 100% in single and multiple stenosis screening, compared with the multiple linear regression model. © 2013 IEEE.},

The use of matrix converter facilitates improved power quality on input as well as motor side, along with Input Power Factor control, besides eliminating the need for heavy passive elements. Moreover, DTC through Space Vector Modulation helps in achieving a fast control over the torque and flux of the motor, with added benefit of constant switching frequency. A constant switching frequency aids in maintaining desired power quality of AC mains current even at low motor speeds, and simplifies input filter design of the matrix converter, as compared to conventional hysteresis based DTC. Further, stator voltage estimation from sensed input voltage, and subsequent stator (and rotor) flux estimation is done. For speed sensorless operation, a Model Reference Adaptive System is used, which emulates the speed dependent rotor flux equations of the induction motor. The error between conventionally estimated rotor flux (reference model) and the rotor flux estimated through the adaptive observer is processed through PI controller to generate the rotor speed estimate. © 2018, The Institution of Engineers (India).},

	abstract = {Wideband large-scale array systems operating at millimeter-wave bands are expected to play a key role in future communication systems. It is recommended by standardization groups to use spherical-wave models (SWMs) to characterize the channel in near-field cases because of the large array apertures and the small cell size. However, this feature is not widely reflected in channel models yet, mainly due to the high computational complexity of SWMs compared to that of the conventional plane-wave model (PWM), especially when ultrawideband signals are considered. In this paper, a maximum likelihood estimator of low computational complexity is implemented with an SWM for ultrawideband signals. The measurement data obtained from an ultrawideband large-scale antenna array system at 28-30 GHz are processed with the proposed algorithm. The power azimuth-delay profiles estimated from the SWM and the PWM are compared to those obtained from rotational horn antenna measurement, respectively. It shows that the multipath components (MPCs) are well-estimated with the proposed algorithm, and significant improvement in estimation performance is achieved with the SWM compared to the PWM. Moreover, the physical interpretation of the estimated MPCs is also given along with the estimated scatterers. © 2002-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The problem of bus imbalance identification in a three-phase power network using a phasor measurement unit (PMU) is considered. We propose new algorithms to identify and localize imbalances occurring at any location in the power grid, based only on single-phase PMU data. First, we develop a technique using the minimum description length (MDL) criterion that is carried out at the control center. The centralized MDL methodology is time consuming and has computational complexity that grows exponentially with the network size. Therefore, we next develop a projected orthogonal matching pursuit (POMP) algorithm, which is a low-complexity method for bus imbalance identification in large-scale power networks implemented at the control center. POMP is a computationally efficient compressive sensing technique that exploits the sparse structure of the voltage measurements. The proposed methods are validated through three case studies: A two-port \pi-model, an IEEE-14 bus system, and an IEEE 118-bus system. Simulations show that our networked algorithms, MDL and POMP, obtain improved performance over local bus-level identification techniques. The performance of POMP is close to that of centralized MDL, with the advantage of being applicable to large-scale networks. © 1969-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a novel solution for transient frequency compensation in weak 3-phase microgrids (MGs) based on a Luenberger observer and a transient frequency detector. Unlike in conventional grids, the low inertia of the generators coupled to an MG could make their rotor speeds to be affected by load changes, varying the grid frequency and compromising the grid quality and stability. This problem has been approached in the literature by the virtual inertia concept. However, the existing solutions are affected by the decoupling of the grid frequency reference and the frequency estimation bandwidth. The proposed paper addresses these problems by the use of a transient frequency drift estimator based on a transient detector and a Luenberger type observer that provides a nearly zero lag frequency estimation. The proposed alternative is analytically compared with the existing techniques and validated through simulation and exhaustive experimental results in an islanded MG. The developed method enables a 1 Hz reduction in the transient frequency deviation when compared with the existing alternatives and improves the system stability. © 2017 IEEE},

	abstract = {In this paper, a high-rate space-time block-coded (STBC) mobile communication system using imperfect channel-state-information (CSI) is presented, which is working over the time-selective flat-fading wireless channels. In the work, a flat-fading channel is modelled as a first-order Markov-process, taking into account Doppler shifts and carrier frequency offsets. The STBC data-rate 5/4 with two-transmitter antennas is attained by maximizing the coding gain and by minimizing the transmitted signal peak-to-minimum-power-ratio, while using the selective power scaling in combination with quadrature-phase-shift-keying digital modulation technique. The time-selective nature of underlying channel leads to reduction in the diversity gain, though optimum power scaling factor is incorporated. However, imperfect CSI usually arises due to the availability of noisy channel estimates at the receiver, which causes system performance degradation. Simulation results are presented to illustrate that the effective throughput in terms of frame-error-rate or symbol-error-rate of the presented data-rate 5/4 STBC system is adversely affected because of the noisy channel estimates. But, an efficient channel estimator helps in combating the time-selectivity of channel, and in turn results in effective throughput improvement under the high signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) conditions only. Subsequently, the data-rate 9/8 STBC system with four-transmitter antennas is explored using similar strategy working over the time-nonselective (time-varying) flat-fading channels, which performs well under the high SNR and low channel estimation noise/error conditions. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

Like other similar broadband standards, PLC is based on the use of a multi-carrier modulation for the transmission. Among the possible multi-carrier approaches, Filter-Bank Multi-Carrier modulation (FBMC) implies the existence of a filter bank that provides some improvements with respect to other schemes. In any case, the performance of the receiver significantly depends on the channel estimation, as well as on the corresponding equalization. In this work, two types of channel equalizers (an Adaptive Sine-modulated/Cosine-modulated filter bank Equalizer for Transmultiplexers-ASCET-and a frequency-domain one) have been analyzed for a FBMC approach in a PLC system, evaluating performances achieved by each one of them in the final system, mainly in terms of the emitted signal recovery. © 2017 IEEE.},

In modern large-scale power grids, the number of deployed meters and the frequency of collecting data have remarkably increased. Such a growth in the spatiotemporal size of collected data overwhelms the existing monitoring system with a centralized star structure. Streaming of data from all meters of the network to the central control center also increases communication latency. To overcome these challenges, the power system is partitioned into subsystems with local estimators, and the DSE process is distributed among local estimators. The distributed DSE is hosted at regional control centers and utilizes distributed extended Kalman filtering based on internodal transformation theory to estimate the dynamic states of power systems. The local estimators only require data within their own subsystem, and information is exchanged only between neighboring subsystems. The proposed distributed DSE is implemented on a 68-bus test system, and its accuracy is demonstrated. © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

Also covered are adaptive methods used to estimate the DPD coefficients that optimize the system. Feedforward compensation is presented as an analog technique for linearization, where the correction is applied in the RF domain after the PA. The chapter is concluded with a section on more detailed discussions of selected topics.

	abstract = {Stepped-frequency waveforms are widely used in ultra-wideband (UWB) radar to obtain high resolution range profiles (HRRPs). In this paper, we consider high range resolution (HRR) improvement, i.e. sidelobe reduction and resolution enhancement, in stepped-frequency radar via weighted SParse Iterative Covariance-based Estimation (weighted SPICE) approach. Weighted SPICE is a unifying approach for four user parameter-free algorithms, namely SPICE, LIKES, SLIM and IAA. The latter three algorithms can be interpreted as weighted versions of SPICE with diï¬€erent data-dependent weights. Weighted SPICE is originally proposed for spectral estimation and array processing. We show that it can be used to obtain HRRPs in stepped-frequency radar as well, and comparisons among these four methods for HRR processing are also discussed in this paper. Additionally, diï¬€erent from spectral estimation applications, the main goal of HRR processing is to estimate the reiflection coefficients {xk } of the targets rather than the powers {pk }. Thus, estimators which are able to obtain estimates {bxk } from {bpk }, such as Linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimator and Capon estimator, are needed after obtaining {bpk } via weighted SPICE. As a minimum variance unbiased estimator, Capon is shown to have a better performance than LMMSE from the perspective of HRR processing. Numerical examples are presented to evaluate the performance of using all weighted SPICE algorithms with the LMMSE and Capon estimators, and IAA with Capon estimator is shown to outperform other weighted SPICE methods. © 2018 SPIE.},

Due to the characteristics of the 5G application scenarios, channel estimation techniques have been tested in Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) and Generalized Frequency Division Multiplexing (GFDM) systems. The orthogonality between subcarriers in OFDM systems permits inserting and extracting pilots without interference. However, due to pulse shaping, subcarriers in GFDM are no longer orthogonal and interfere with each other. Due to such interference, the channel estimation for GFDM is not trivial. A robust and low-complexity channel estimator can be obtained by combining a minimum mean-square error (MMSE) regularization and the basis expansion model (BEM) approach. In this work, we develop a BEM-type channel estimator along with a strategy to obtain the covariance matrix of the BEM coefficients. Simulations show that the BEM-type channel estimation shows performance close to that of the linear MMSE (LMMSE), even though there is no need to know the channel power delay profile, and its complexity is low. © 2018 VDE VERLAG GMBH ∙ Berlin ∙ Offenbach},

The angular support is recovered without any discretization by treating the angular channel in a continuous framework which resolves the limited angular resolution of the discrete sparse channel models used in the previous CS-based channel estimators. The power leakage problem is also addressed by modeling the continuous angular channel as a multi-band signal with the bandwidth of each sub-band being proportional to the amount of power leakage caused by the limited antenna array length. The RF combiner is implemented using a network of low-power switches for antenna subset selection based on a multi-coset sampling pattern.

Specifically, a nonorthogonal uplink pilot design scheme is employed to reduce the pilot overhead, then the compressive sensing model is established. By exploiting the structured sparsity and energy concentration property of the beam-delay domain channel, the energy-concentration based channel estimation algorithm is proposed by utilizing the sparsity level of channels.

	abstract = {Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) have been subject to important research efforts for the past years. They are indeed expected to fulfil the needs of a variety of emerging human centric applications at very low cost and ultra-low power (e.g. healthcare, wellness, security, sports, gaming). Even more recently these networks have been considered for radiolocation purposes (i.e. out of transmitted signals on and around the body). This new localization add-on is rather based on the estimation of the separating distance between the WBANs devices, based on radio technologies such as Narrow-Band (N-B) and/or even Impulse Radio-Ultra Wideband (IR-UWB). In this context we present herein a theoretical modeling of WBANs ranging errors based on IR-UWB Time Of Arrival (TOA) estimation. This model consists in applying a Cramer Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) expression for discussions, after extracting realistic Channel Impulse Response (CIR) out of recent UWB multipath channel measurement campaign. The CRLB of any unbiased TOA estimator is computed in the [3.1, 5.1]GHz and [3.75, 4.25]GHz bands. The latter frequency band is compliant with the channel 2 of the IEEE 802.15.4a standard, as well as with one mandatory band imposed by the IEEE 802.15.6 standardization group. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The disturbances including harmonics, distortions, transients, fluctuations, and dc offsets in the grid voltages and uncertain load currents, are the most challenging issues in the scenario of renewable sources based energy generating systems integrated to the conventional grid. A three-phase, double stage, grid tied solar photovoltaic based distributed generating (SPVDG) system fulfilling multiple objectives, is presented using an adaptive digital disturbance estimator (DDE) and a peak power tracking scheme. The adaptive DDE has the detection proficiency of all the harmonics and lumped disturbances resulting fundamental component estimation of the periodic signals such as grid voltages and load currents. This system deals with objectives such as reactive power compensation, load balancing, peak solar power extraction, operation at grid voltage sags and swells, estimation of harmonics, dc offsets, disturbances, etc. and their elimination. Moreover, this system ensures the active power flow from the SPVDG system to the local loads as well as the grid through a three-phase voltage source converter (VSC). An adaptive technique is used to adjust the dc-link voltage with respect to the grid voltage variation(s) that is advantageous in terms of losses in the VSC. A Lyapunov function candidate is considered to estimate the gains of the disturbance estimator confirming its parameter convergence. Considering the aforementioned objectives, SPVDG system with the proposed DDE-based control scheme, is simulated using Matlab/Simulink environment and then practically implemented using a prototype developed in the laboratory to confirm its performance under steady and dynamic conditions. © 1972-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {False data injection attacks (FDIAs) against the automatic generation control (AGC) system can lead to unstable or non-optimal operation of the power grid. This paper introduces a method to detect FDIAs targeting the AGC system by developing a stochastic unknown input estimator (SUIE). The SUIE estimates the states of the load-frequency control system, which contains the AGC as a control loop. An increase in the SUIE's residual function (RF) beyond a defined threshold signifies an FDIA. The SUIE can be designed such that it works independently from some or all inputs to the system's state-space model. In addition, the effect of process and measurement noise on the estimated states is minimized through an optimal gain setting technique for the SUIE. Therefore, not only does the SUIE eliminate the need for information about real-time load changes throughout the grid, it also maximizes the state estimation accuracy. The combination of these features distinguishes the proposed method from existing FDIA detection techniques for the AGC system. This paper also develops a number of attack identification SUIEs (AISUIEs) to determine which measurements are compromised by an FDIA, thus facilitating FDIA mitigation strategies. The AISUIEs model FDIAs targeting each AGC measurement by an attack input. These inputs serve as the unknown inputs of different AISUIEs, whose RFs indicate the type of attack. The designed AISUIEs also differentiate between attacks and non-attack abnormalities such as faults. Simulation analysis of a three-area power system corroborates the effectiveness of the proposed method. In addition, the performance of the proposed method is tested using an OPAL real-time simulator, and is compared with another technique from the literature. © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

The count-min sketch and related hash-based data structures are ubiquitous in systems that must track frequencies of data such as URLs, IP addresses, and language n-grams. We present a Bayesian view on the count-min sketch, using the same data structure, but providing a posterior distribution over the frequencies that characterizes the uncertainty arising from the hash-based approximation. In particular, we take a nonparametric approach and consider tokens generated from a Dirichlet process (DP) random measure, which allows for an unbounded number of unique tokens. Using properties of the DP, we show that it is possible to straightforwardly compute posterior marginals of the unknown true counts and that the modes of these marginals recover the count-min sketch estimator, inheriting the associated probabilistic guarantees. Using simulated data and text data, we investigate the properties of these estimators. Lastly, we also study a modified problem in which the observation stream consists of collections of tokens (i.e., documents) arising from a random measure drawn from a stable beta process, which allows for power law scaling behavior in the number of unique tokens. © 2018 Curran Associates Inc.All rights reserved.},

Moreover, an optimized implementation of the band pass filter (BPF) based voltage model is proposed. With the proposed scheme, not only the DC offset in the estimated flux is eliminated, but also the dynamic performance is improved and the unsatisfied high-frequency noise is reduced.

	abstract = {Localised and high-frequency measurements of the global horizontal irradiance (GHI) are a key information to assess the level of power production of distributed photovoltaic generation. The paper presents a supervised machine learning-based procedure to estimate the GHI using images obtained from an all-sky camera installed at ground level. The training phase consists, at first, in extracting a large set of features from historical images and sub-selecting them using principal component analysis (PCA). The set of selected features is used to train an artificial neural network (ANN) considering the clear-sky index as the estimated variable and output of the ANN. Then, the same procedure is augmented by considering features from satellites images (i.e., SEVIRI thermal channels). The output of the proposed estimator is compared against ground truth measurements from a pyranometer located in the proximity of the camera and benchmarked against state-of-the-art Heliosat-2 estimations. The performance assessment is presented for four different periods of the year, and for three different time resolutions (i.e., 1, 5, and 15 min). Results show that the estimator based only on images features outperforms the others, and improves the Heliosat-2 estimations by 20–45% (relative improvement in terms of normalized root mean square error). © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In a bidirectional converter, the inductor current is needed to control the power flow between the source and the load. Sensing the inductor current for the use of a digital controller requires a wide bandwidth current sensor and a high speed Analog to Digital Converter (ADC). The high speed ADC is a costly device and complicates the physical implementation because it is prone to noise. Hence, estimation of the inductor current instead of sensing is a topic of research. This paper proposes a technique which can estimate the current through an inductor irrespective of the direction of current flow. The proposed technique eliminates the need for a high speed ADC and wide bandwidth current sensor. The proposed inductor current estimator is compatible to be used directly with a digital controller. This can estimate both the average DC and the switching frequency ripple components of the inductor current. Since, the switch node voltage of the converter gives the real time status of the converter. Switch node voltage of the converter is used for estimating the inductor current in the proposed technique. The switch node voltage is sensed using a low cost discrete comparator. Detailed theory and practical implementation procedure of the proposed technique are given. Experimental results to validate the proposed current estimation technique are given. The experimental results validate the proposed technique for both forward and reverse operation with the accuracy up to 10%. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Side-effect modulation (SEM) has the potential to be a significant source of interference in future visible light communication (VLC) systems. SEM is a variation in the intensity of the light emitted by a luminaire and is usually a side effect caused by the power supply used to drive the luminaires. For LED luminaires powered by a switched mode power supply, the SEM can be at much higher frequencies than that emitted by conventional incandescent or fluorescent lighting. It has been shown that the SEM caused by commercially available LED luminaires is often periodic and of low power. In this paper, we investigate the impact of typical forms of SEM on the performance of optical OFDM VLC systems; both ACO-OFDM and DCO-OFDM are considered. Our results show that even low levels of SEM power can significantly degrade the bit-error-rate performance. To solve this problem, an SEM mitigation scheme is described. The mitigation scheme is decision-directed and is based on estimating and subtracting the fundamental component of the SEM from the received signal. We describe two forms of the algorithm; one uses blind estimation, while the other uses pilot-assisted estimation based on a training sequence. Decision errors, resulting in decision noise, limit the performance of the blind estimator even when estimation is based on very long signals. However, the pilot system can achieve more accurate estimations, and thus a better performance. Results are first presented for typical SEM waveforms for the case where the fundamental frequency of the SEM is known. The algorithms are then extended to include a frequency estimation step and the mitigation algorithm is shown also to be effective in this case. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {To increase output torque in the constant power region of interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM) for electric vehicle/hybrid electric vehicle applications, a novel torque control based on voltage phase angle control is proposed to provide more accurate torque for the IPMSM. First, the mathematic model of the IPMSM under six-step voltage operation is derived. Then, the phasor diagram based on the fundamental frequency and ideal condition is used to explain the relation between the torque, power, and voltage phase angle. Moreover, Maxwell 2D simulation for the IPMSM shows the detailed phenomena including generated torque, phase current, and magnetic flux distribution for developing controllers. Hence, the proposed method uses phase voltage advancing angle to yield torque, which consists of a command feed-forward controller to give a fast dynamic response, a proportional-integral regulator, a high-resolution voltage angle injection to reduce torque ripple and an efficiency-based torque estimator to enhance torque accuracy under six-step voltage operation. Finally, a digital signal processor(DSP)-based motor drive is built to verify the proposed method using a 6 kW/47 Nm/1200 rpm IPMSM. The experimental results measured by a torque transducer are derived to show that the torque ripple is significantly reduced, torque accuracy is improved, and constant power control achieved is from 1800 to 3600 rpm. These results, therefore, confirm the superior performance of the proposed control method. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2018},

	abstract = {In the future, phasor measurement units are expected to be applied in distribution networks (DNs) for their control and monitoring. Because of the widely used power electronic devices in DNs, harmonics are widely present in a voltage/current signal. Particularly, second harmonics have the most significant uncertainty contributions to synchrophasor estimation, which is especially true when a short cycle observation window is used for a fast response. Based on the interpolated dynamic discrete Fourier transform (IpD2FT), this paper introduces an enhanced IpD2FT (e-IpD2FT) synchrophasor estimator that considers second harmonic interferences. First, the adaptive equivalent filters of the IpD2FT are given. Based on these, the optimal frequencies where the IpD2FT has the least second harmonic interferences are then searched using an enumeration method, and the e-IpD2FT synchrophasor estimator is accordingly proposed. Instantaneous frequency responses and several simulation tests show that the e-IpD2FT performs much better than the IpD2FT in second harmonic suppression, and can meet the P-class response time requirements and most of the M-class accuracy requirements of the IEEE standard C37.118.1 only over a three-cycle window. © 2018 by the authors.

	abstract = {Self-governed micro power networks are a promising solution for meeting the energy needs of isolated communities not having access to regular transmission networks. The control of such isolated networks requires regulation and “fair” sharing of several power generation and storage resources as well as efficient peer-to-peer coordination between power converters operating in the network. The regulation of key parameters as voltage, frequency and power sharing is to be ensured for the system to operate optimally. This paper proposes a new, de-centralized, and hierarchical control approach for power inverters in isolated micro networks with multi-layered controls, each addressing the regulation of key system parameters. The proposed scheme uses distributed quasi-averaging estimators at each participating node to achieve resilience towards disturbances caused by delayed transmission of measurement and control signals in the data acquisition and information exchange layer. Detailed system models are developed using MATLAB and Sim-power systems to test the effectiveness of the proposed scheme under varying control and network scenarios. The results of these studies are presented as pole zero evolutions, stability margins and case study wise simulations. The studies carried out verify the validity of the proposed control strategy for micro-distribution networks. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Multicarrier wireless communication systems, which usually operate over frequency-selective fading channels, are practically also impaired by environmental impulsive noise. In order to boost the signal-to-noise power ratio (SNR) at the receiver, this paper proposes and analyzes nonlinear estimators based on the multiple thresholding, with associated piecewise attenuation, or clipping, of the received signal amplitude. The proposed approach exploits a new heuristic criterion to set the thresholds. Although the obtained thresholds are slightly suboptimal in output SNR, the proposed approach has the nice and useful property to allow closed-form analytical derivations for both the threshold(s) and the associated attenuating/clipping parameters, when a Gaussian source is impaired by an impulsive noise. Such a quite general class of estimators, which could be applied also in other scenarios, is particularly attractive for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing communication systems in the presence of additive multicomponent impulsive noise. We are also letting to derive closed-form expressions for the output SNR in frequency-selective multipath fading channels. The SNR performance and the associated symbol error rate have been compared with those of more traditional blanking, clipping, and clipping-blanking processors. Specifically, analytical and simulation results, carried out for Class-A and symmetrical alpha-stable (SαS) impulsive noise, show that the proposed threshold-based suppressors are superior to the traditional ones. Furthermore, as the number of thresholds increases, the proposed estimators closely approach the performance of the optimal minimum mean square error Bayesian estimator. However, as it is shown, in practical conditions only few thresholds are necessary. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In full-duplex (FD) multi-input multi-output (MIMO)- orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, the performance of self-interference (SI) cancellation suffers severe degradations due to the presence of stochastic phase noise (PN), which introduces certain estimation error for the SI channel state information (CSI). Following a new design principle to minimize the residual SI power, we look for an optimal linear SI channel estimator for the FD MIMO- OFDM systems with PN. After formulating the residual SI power, a closed-form solution of the optimal linear SI channel estimator is derived by solving a series of quadratic programming problems. Such an optimal SI channel estimator requires information including the covariances between different taps of the SI channel, the relative PN bandwidth, the noise power, and the power of the transmitted signal. Simulation and numerical results show that our proposed scheme outperforms the conventional least square (LS) or minimum mean square error (MMSE) channel estimators, in terms of achieving higher digital SI cancellation ability under various scenarios. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Optimization for power is one of the most important design objectives in modern digital image processing applications. The DCT is considered to be one of the most essential techniques in image and video compression systems, and consequently a number of extensive works had been carried out by researchers on the power optimization. On the other hand, quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) can present a novel opportunity for the design of highly parallel architectures and algorithms for improving the performance of image and video processing systems. Furthermore, it has considerable advantages in comparison with CMOS technology, such as extremely low power dissipation, high operating frequency, and a small size. Therefore, in this study, the authors propose a multiplier-less DCT architecture in QCA technology. The proposed design provides high circuit performance, very low power consumption, and very low dimension outperform to the existing conventional structures. The QCADesigner tool has been utilized for QCA circuit design and functional verification of all designs in this work. QCAPro, a very widespread power estimator tool, is applied to estimate the power dissipation of the proposed circuit. The suggested design has 53% improvement in terms of power over the conventional solution. The outcome of this work can clearly open up a new window of opportunity for low power image processing systems. © 2019 Ismail Gassoumi et al.},

In this letter, we exploit deep learning to handle wireless OFDM channels in an end-to-end manner. Different from existing OFDM receivers that first estimate channel state information (CSI) explicitly and then detect/recover the transmitted symbols using the estimated CSI, the proposed deep learning-based approach estimates CSI implicitly and recovers the transmitted symbols directly. To address channel distortion, a deep learning model is first trained offline using the data generated from simulation based on channel statistics and then used for recovering the online transmitted data directly. From our simulation results, the deep learning based approach can address channel distortion and detect the transmitted symbols with performance comparable to the minimum mean-square error estimator. Furthermore, the deep learning-based approach is more robust than conventional methods when fewer training pilots are used, the cyclic prefix is omitted, and nonlinear clipping noise exists. In summary, deep learning is a promising tool for channel estimation and signal detection in wireless communications with complicated channel distortion and interference. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Visible light communication (VLC)-based localization is a potential candidate for a wide range of indoor localization applications. In this paper, we propose a VLC architecture based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) with multiple functionalities integrated into the same system, i.e., the 3-D receiver location, the control of the room illumination intensity, as well as the data transmission capability. In this paper, we propose an original methodology for LED power discrimination applying spatial optical OFDM (SO-OFDM) structure for position estimation. The hybrid locator initially makes a first estimate using a weighted angle-of-arrival (WAoA)-based locator, which is then used as the starting point of the recursive estimator based on the strength of the received signal. Hence, the first stage is deployed to increase the convergence probability, reducing the root-mean-square error (RMSE) and the number of iterations of the second stage. Also, a performance versus computational complexity comparative analysis is carried out with the parameter variations of these estimators. The numerical results indicate a decade improvement in the RMSE for every two decades of decrement of power noise on the receiver photodiode. The best clipping factor is obtained through the analysis of locator accuracy and transmission capacity for each simulated system. Finally, the numerical results also demonstrate effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of the proposed architecture. © 2013 IEEE.},

The paper derives a simple closed-form for both ICFO estimation and compensation processes, by considering not only the shift in subcarrier indices as an effect of the ICFO, which is commonly seen in the literature, but also a phase accumulation resulting from the combined effect of the ICFO and the presence of a Cyclic Prefix (CP). We present an estimation method robust to both multipath channel and time offset, as well as a simple compensation scheme in the frequency domain, which makes uses only of shift and sign operations. We also detail the implemented architecture and present results of performance simulation and RTL synthesis. The simulation results show the algorithm is robust to symbol boundary error and to channel with exponential power delay profile, with good performance under low SNR, achieving a failure rate of 0.1% at -3dB for one of the studied cases. The synthesis targeting Altera Cyclone IV GX FPGA resulted in 8% of resource usage. This ICFO estimator/compensator is part of a project that aims to implement in ASIC the three PHYs defined in the standard and integrate them to build a system fully compliant to IEEE 802.15.4g. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Speech recognition in adverse real-world environments is highly affected by reverberation and non-stationary background noise. A well-known strategy to reduce such undesired signal components in multi-microphone scenarios is spatial filtering of the microphone signals. In this article, we demonstrate that an additional coherence-based postfilter, which is applied to the beamformer output signal to remove diffuse interference components from the latter, is an effective means to further improve the recognition accuracy of modern deep learning speech recognition systems. To this end, the 3rd CHiME Speech Separation and Recognition Challenge (CHiME-3) baseline speech enhancement system is extended by a coherence-based postfilter and the postfilter's impact on the Word Error Rates (WERs) of a state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition system is investigated for the realistic noisy environments provided by CHiME-3. To determine the time- and frequency-dependent postfilter gains, we use Direction-of-Arrival (DOA)-dependent and (DOA)-independent estimators of the coherent-to-diffuse power ratio as an approximation of the short-time signal-to-noise ratio. Our experiments show that incorporating coherence-based postfiltering into the CHiME-3 baseline speech enhancement system leads to a significant reduction of the WERs, with relative improvements of up to 11.31%. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Estimation of linear Time-Frequency varying signal parameters is a computationally expensive process. Traditional estimation methods have several drawbacks that affect the performance of these estimators. Compressive sensing is a novel statistical approach that can make use of signal sparsity in a certain domain to fully recover the signal from fewer coefficients or measurements. Recent work on applying compressive sensing (CS) for chirp estimation has been reported in literature [1] [2], but these methods require super-resolution transformation causing a high post processing burden especially for real-time wide-band signals. To address this limitation, we propose to use a lower resolution measurements matrix with a wide range of estimated parameters. We apply low resolution Discrete Chirp Fourier Transform (DCFT) [3] with selected number of measurements to obtain prior signal information. Next, constrained high resolution transformation matrix is used by making use of the prior information obtained earlier. This would reduce the computational burden applied using super resolution of direct CS method. Multiple chirp signals are also considered, the effect of minimum signal separation, difference in amplitude of chirp signals and transformation resolution was studied based on simulation results and driven equations. Effect of noise has been studied, and the results show high immunity in the recovery process because CS had performed as filter for low side-lopes coefficients, even with very few measurements deployed. © 2017 IEEE.},

Considering the dynamic range of the analog-to-digital converter and the linearity of the receiver chain, the achievable signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio and the capacity of the FD MIMO system are both derived as a function of residual SI power after the MT cancellation. Simulation results show that the cancellation ability decreases as the tap delay alignment errors increase or the estimator signal-to-noise ratio reduces, which results in the loss of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio of the intended terminal. As a result, considering the linearity of the receiver, we demonstrate that the capacity of FD transceivers with the high transmit power suffers from significant rate gain loss conditioned on 1% tap delay alignment errors. © 2017 IEEE.},

The algorithm consists of a signal transformation, a biased adaptive orthogonal decomposition (BAOD) and a symmetrical component estimation. The BAOD can be regarded as a combination of a low pass filter and a number of three-phase frequency estimators in parallel. The symmetrical component estimation employs addition and multiplication rather than operations of trigonometry, division and phase shift. The decomposition property and the convergence property were investigated by Lyapunov theorem, integral manifold of slow adaptation and average method. Two design parameters, bandwidth parameter and frequency adaptive gains, give different effects on the convergence property of frequency adaptation and amplitude estimation independently.

	abstract = {The Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) are currently considered among the most useful instruments for smart grid monitoring. While the traditional PMUs deployed at the transmission level are usually high-performance and expensive instruments, the interest in smaller and cheaper units able to perform synchronized measurements of voltage and current waveforms at the distribution level is currently growing. In this paper, a feasibility study about the implementation of state-of-the-art estimation algorithms for PMUs in low-cost embedded platforms is presented. The proposed approach relies on an Interpolated Discrete Fourier Transform (IpDFT) for static frequency offset estimation followed by a modified Taylor-Fourier Transform (TFT) for waveform amplitude, phase, frequency and rate of change of frequency (ROCOF) estimation under dynamic conditions. Both algorithms, implemented in C++, run on a Beagle-Bone Black board. After evaluating the total computation time as a function of both the sampling rate and the number of observed cycles, a criterion to choose the data acquisition stage is described. Finally, the accuracy of synchrophasor, frequency and ROCOF estimators is determined by emulating most of the testing conditions reported in the IEEE Standards C37.118.1-2011 and C37.118.1a-2014. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The estimation of the noise power is a core issue in wireless communication systems. In broadcasting, every OFDM frame starts with a preamble symbol, which facilitates the noise power estimation. However, the performance of preamble-based noise estimation schemes worsens in fast-changing environments and cannot efficiently track the noise variation well. In order to track the noise variation symbol to symbol, pilot-based schemes would be more fruitful. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose a novel pilot-based noise power estimation scheme for OFDM systems that estimate the noise power for each data symbol. It makes use of the pilot subcarriers reserved for channel estimation in the data symbol. The proposed algorithm computes the circular correlation between received signal and comb type sub-pilot subsequence twice to generate the noise power. Compared with the conventional preamble-based scheme, the proposed pilot-based noise algorithm generates near-ideal accuracy at different values of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Without the additional overheads of the preamble, the scheme offers the significant saving of computation over a conventional time domain noise estimator. © 2017 IEEE.},

Then the frequency is estimated based on the largest spectrum peak.

Each receiver antenna of the base station is assumed to be equipped with a pair of one-bit analog-to-digital converters to quantize the real and imaginary part of the received signal. We first propose an approach for channel estimation that is applicable for both flat and frequency-selective fading, based on the Bussgang decomposition that reformulates the nonlinear quantizer as a linear function with identical first- and second-order statistics. The resulting channel estimator outperforms previously proposed approaches across all SNRs. We then derive closed-form expressions for the achievable rate in flat fading channels assuming low SNR and a large number of users for the maximal ratio and zero forcing receivers that takes channel estimation error due to both noise and one-bit quantization into account. The closed-form expressions, in turn, allow us to obtain insight into important system design issues such as optimal resource allocation, maximal sum spectral efficiency, overall energy efficiency, and number of antennas. Numerical results are presented to verify our analytical results and demonstrate the benefit of optimizing system performance accordingly. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {When the power system is suffered from disturbances, such as unbalance, load variation, and fault occurrence, not only the phase and magnitude of the power signal will change but also the fundamental frequency can deviate away from the nominal one up to 5 Hz as per IEEE standard C37.118. As large frequency deviation will lead to great errors on Taylor approximation, the accuracy can be improved by expanding the dynamic characteristics in form of Taylor series near real fundamental frequency of supplied signals instead of nominal frequency (50/60 Hz). The corresponding coefficient against the different frequency estimations is applied to the dynamic phasor estimator to yield accurate synchrophasor estimation with the consideration of large frequency deviation. First, raw phasors attained by short time Fourier transform, are employed to provide the frequency estimation. Then, according to the frequency estimation, the coefficient matrix calculated off-line in form of lookup table is selected to calculate phasor estimation at the center of data window. Finally, a shift process is taken to give phasor estimation at report time. Simulated signals, PSCAD-generated signal, RTDS-generated data, and field data are employed to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. The results show that the proposed algorithm can get more accurate phasor estimations than our previous work at most of the time with the cost of minor increase of computational power. © 2010-2012 IEEE.},

Furthermore, The so-mentioned architecture incorporates ordered successive interference canceler minimum means square Error (OSIC-MMSE) as receiver, in order to offer an additional reliability of the wireless link. A comparative performance study between the proposed architecture, the least square estimator and half duplex (HD) architectures is performed. To the best of author knowledge, the performance of the aforementioned architecture was not previously investigated, more particularly SI power is characterized under Rician distribution.

	abstract = {Radiation detection used in positron emission tomography (PET) exploits the timing information to remove background noise and refine position measurement through time-of-flight information. Fine time resolution in the order of 10 ps full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) would not only improve contrast in the image, but would also enable direct image reconstruction without iterative or back-projected algorithms. Currently, PET experimental setups based on silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) reach 73 ps FWHM, where the scintillation process plays the larger role in spreading the timing resolution. This will change with the optimization of faster light emission mechanisms (prompt photons), where readout optoelectronics will once more have a noticeable contribution to the timing resolution limit. In addition to reducing electronic jitter as much as possible, other aspects of the design space must also explored, especially for digital SiPMs. Unlike traditional SiPMs, digital SiPMs can integrate circuits like time-to-digital converters (TDCs) directly with individual or groups of light sensing cells. Designers should consider the number of TDCs to integrate, the area they occupy, their power consumption, their resolution, and the impact of signal processing algorithms and find a compromise with the figure of merit and the coincidence timing resolution (CTR). This paper presents a parametric simulation flow for digital SiPM microsystems that evaluates CTR based on these aspects and on the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE) in order to guide their design for present and future PET systems. For a small 1.1-1.1-3.0mm3 LYSO crystal, the simulations indicate that for a low jitter digital SiPM microsystem with 18.2% photon detection efficiency, fewer than four timestamps with any multi-TDC configuration scheme nearly obtain the optimal CTR with BLUE (just below 100 ps FWHM), but with limited 5% improvement over only using the first observed photon. On the other hand, if a similar crystal but with 2.5% prompt photon fraction is considered, BLUE provides an improvement between 80% and 200% (depending on electronic jitter) over using only the first observed photon. In this case, a few tens of timestamps are required, yielding very different design guidelines than for standard LYSO scintillators. © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {We study the X-ray variability properties of distant active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the Chandra Deep Field-South region over 17 yr, up to z ~4, and compare them with those predicted by models based on local samples. We use the results of Monte Carlo simulations to account for the biases introduced by the discontinuous sampling and the low-count regime. We confirm that variability is a ubiquitous property of AGNs, with no clear dependence on the density of the environment. The variability properties of high-z AGNs, over different temporal time-scales, are most consistent with a power spectral density (PSD) described by a broken (or bending) power law, similar to nearby AGNs. We confirm the presence of an anticorrelation between luminosity and variability, resulting from the dependence of variability on black hole (BH) mass and accretion rate. We explore different models, finding that our acceptable solutions predict that BH mass influences the value of the PSD break frequency, while the Eddington ratio λEdd affects the PSD break frequency and, possibly, the PSD amplitude as well. We derive the evolution of the average λEdd as a function of redshift, finding results in agreement with measurements based on different estimators. The large statistical uncertainties make our results consistent with a constant Eddington ratio, although one of our models suggest a possible increase of λEdd with lookback time up to z ~2-3. We conclude that variability is a viable mean to trace the accretion history of supermassive BHs, whose usefulness will increase with future, wide-field/large effective area X-ray missions. © 2017 The Authors.},

The functional interference effect index (FIEI) of each variable was computed as the CFAOT to CFT+AOT ratio. In relation to CFT+AOT, CFAOT showed: greater initial sympathetic estimators overshoots, associated to greater SP and dmAP increments and RR, BRS and RSAS undershoots, all with FIEI>1; followed by vagal increase and gradual recoveries of BRS, RSAS, sympathetic and cardiovascular estimators with FIEI>1. At the end, all variables but RR presented FIEI<1. CFAOT initially induces a potentiative sympathetic activation associated to great reductions of RR, BRS and RSAS, and potentiative SP and dmAP increases, followed by potentiative sympathetic recovery and vagal activation with potentiative RR, BRS, RSAS, SP and dmAP gradual recoveries that become suppressive at the end. FIEI of all variables fluctuates between suppressive and potentiative, showing the convergence of autonomic inputs. © 2017 IEEE Computer Society. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In many communications scenarios, the channel exhibits periodic characteristics, e.g., power line communications and interference-limited communications. Additionally, certain approximations for mobile radio channels over finite time intervals may result in periodic channel models. In this paper, we study pilot-aided joint estimation of the channel impulse response (CIR) and of the carrier frequency offset (CFO) for linear periodic channels, in which both the CIR and the noise statistics vary periodically in time. We first consider the joint maximum likelihood estimator (JMLE) for the CIR and the CFO, and discuss the practical drawbacks associated with this estimator. When the coefficients of the delay-Doppler spread function of the CIR are approximately sparse, we propose two estimation schemes with higher spectral efficiency and lower computational complexity compared with the JMLE, which are obtained by exploiting both the periodicity and the sparsity of the channel, without requiring a priori knowledge of the sparsity pattern. Finally, we study the design of pilot sequences aimed at improving the estimation performance in sparse periodic channels. Simulation studies corresponding to practical scenarios of the proposed estimators demonstrate that substantial benefits can be obtained by properly accounting for the sparsity and periodicity in the design of estimation schemes. © 1972-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Recently researchers have started employing Monte Carlo-like line sample estimators in rendering, demonstrating dramatic reductions in variance (visible noise) for effects such as soft shadows, defocus blur, and participating media. Unfortunately, there is currently no formal theoretical framework to predict and analyze Monte Carlo variance using line and segment samples which have inherently anisotropic Fourier power spectra. In this work, we propose a theoretical formulation for lines and finite-length segment samples in the frequency domain that allows analyzing their anisotropic power spectra using previous isotropic variance and convergence tools. Our analysis shows that judiciously oriented line samples not only reduce the dimensionality but also pre-filter C0 discontinuities, resulting in further improvement in variance and convergence rates. Our theoretical insights also explain how finite-length segment samples impact variance and convergence rates only by pre-filtering discontinuities. We further extend our analysis to consider (uncorrelated) multi-directional line (segment) sampling, showing that such schemes can increase variance compared to unidirectional sampling. We validate our theoretical results with a set of experiments including direct lighting, ambient occlusion, and volumetric caustics using points, lines, and segment samples. © 2017 The Author(s) Computer Graphics Forum © 2017 The Eurographics Association and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

However, ship monitoring systems using high frequency radars suffer from the fact that a detection position is far away from true position. To resolve this problem, the proposed method determines final location by applying Bayesian estimator to detection results from each ship monitoring system in high frequency radar network. According to Bayesian theory, a posterior distribution is factorized into likelihood and prior distributions, and both distributions are modeled by using each detection results and auto-identification system data, respectively. Effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through appropriate synthetic and real data.

These estimators are based on the maximum-likelihood technique and exploit the multidimensional nature of electrical signals. To minimize the likelihood function, we present an optimization algorithm based on the Newton-Raphson technique. While the performance of Fourier-based estimators significantly degrades when the window length is not equal to a multiple of the fundamental half-period, the proposed estimators perform well regardless of the window length. Simulation results show that the proposed estimators clearly outperform the discrete-time Fourier transform in terms of total vector error and frequency error whatever the signal-to-noise ratio, harmonic and interharmonic distortion, and off-nominal frequency deviation are. The benefits of the proposed estimators are also illustrated with real power system data obtained from the DOE/EPRI National Database of power system events. © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {There are currently around 78 nuclear power plants (NPPs) in the world based on Boiling Water Reactors (BWRs). The current parameter to assess BWR instability issues is the linear Decay Ratio (DR). However, it is well known that BWRs are complex non-linear dynamical systems that may even exhibit chaotic dynamics that normally preclude the use of the DR when the BWR is working at a specific operating point during instability. In this work a novel methodology based on an adaptive Shannon Entropy estimator and on Noise Assisted Empirical Mode Decomposition variants is presented. This methodology was developed for real-time implementation of a stability monitor. This methodology was applied to a set of signals stemming from several NPPs reactors (Ringhals-Sweden, Forsmark-Sweden and Laguna Verde-Mexico) under commercial operating conditions, that experienced instabilities events, each one of a different nature. © 2017 by the authors.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes to process the tracking and demodulation of two wireless signals at the same time in a single channel, via a BandPass Sampling front-end and any antenna arrangement. We propose two new multi-signal-PLL designs that can achieve this. These PLLs can track these two signals without losing lock (or cycle slipping) to any one of them, irrespective of the frequency step/gap between the two input signals frequencies (pull-in range). The Bluetooth (BT) and the GPS-L1CA (GPS) signals are chosen to test our two PLL designs. This is because these two signals are diverse, challenging and used extensively in Smartphones. The design challenge was to continually lock to the GPS signal while BT is communicating using the same receive chain, thus saving power and silicon. This has necessitated the design of a PLL with wide pull-in range and fast switching cycle. Our new multi-mode PLL’s design is based on integrating an adaptive Frequency Estimator (FE) into a standard version of the Costas PLL. The FE provides an estimated frequency of the received signal to modify the free-running frequency of the NCO that will enhance the performance of the PLL by increasing its lock-in range. To estimate the frequency, in our first PLL design approach, we used an adaptive IIR notch filter model using the least square method to (1) solve the minimization problem that relates the current received signal with the previous output of the filter, and (2) update the filter parameter that estimate the fundamental frequency. For our second PLL design approach, a numerical differentiation model is used to perform a fourth-order differentiation on the received signal samples in order to calculate the fundamental frequency. © 1995-2017, The Institute of Navigation, Inc.},

In general, VSO increases the turbine operating discharge and gives higher efficiency over a wide operating range. It is particularly advantageous under conditions different from the original design conditions. Changing of the hydrological conditions requires adjustments to the control system; therefore, the new maximum efficiency point tracking (MEPT) algorithm is proposed. The MEPT algorithm implemented in the load controller employs the gradient method. The water level governor based on the PI controller combined with the adaptive load controller is analyzed. The troublesome measurement of the turbine discharge is replaced by the neural-network-based estimator. The correlation analysis of the system parameters was performed by using principal component analysis.

	abstract = {Single molecule super-resolution microscopy is a powerful tool that enables imaging at sub-diffraction-limit resolution. In this technique, subsets of stochastically photoactivated fluorophores are imaged over a sequence of frames and accurately localized, and the estimated locations are used to construct a high-resolution image of the cellular structures labeled by the fluorophores. Available localization methods typically first determine the regions of the image that contain emitting fluorophores through a process referred to as detection. Then, the locations of the fluorophores are estimated accurately in an estimation step. We propose a novel localization method which combines the detection and estimation steps. The method models the given image as the frequency response of a multi-order system obtained with a balanced state space realization algorithm based on the singular value decomposition of a Hankel matrix, and determines the locations of intensity peaks in the image as the pole locations of the resulting system. The locations of the most significant peaks correspond to the locations of single molecules in the original image. Although the accuracy of the location estimates is reasonably good, we demonstrate that, by using the estimates as the initial conditions for a maximum likelihood estimator, refined estimates can be obtained that have a standard deviation close to the Cramér-Rao lower bound-based limit of accuracy. We validate our method using both simulated and experimental multi-emitter images. © 2017 SPIE.},

The deviation-induced estimation error is derived analytically as a function of pulse broadening caused by chromatic dispersion and averaged noise power, and thereby the optimum averaging window size can be determined. To avoid the deviation, we propose an unbiased channel estimation algorithm based on the discrete Fresnel transform (DFnT) for CO-OFDM systems, utilizing the convolution-preservation property of DFnT for intra-symbol averaging. It is shown that the DFnT-based channel estimator converges to the actual channel response under estimation, and achieves better performance than the ISFA estimator, especially in highly dispersive channels. Finally, numerical results are provided to confirm the analysis and its advantages. © 1989-2012 IEEE.},

In this paper, we propose an algorithm to cancel the IN and NBI simultaneously for an OFDM based PLC system. The proposed method exploits the duality of the problem, where the IN is sparse in the time domain and the NBI is sparse in the frequency domain. By virtue of this duality, we use multiple signal characterization (MUSIC) algorithm to estimate both the IN support (in time domain) and the frequency of NBI (in frequency domain). Furthermore, the minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator is used to estimate the amplitude and phase of IN samples at the determined locations and the least square (LS) estimator is used to estimate the amplitude and phase of the NBI. Finally, the estimated IN and NBI are canceled out from the received signal, providing noise mitigated samples for demodulation.

It is so flexible and adaptable to stay in power even in the coming up 5G technologies. The relative motion of the transmitter and receiver can bring alteration in the channel within the time period of an OFDM, hence OFDM causes loss of orthogonally between sub carrier which results in inter-carrier interference. In order to overcome these issues, an adaptive modulation and interference cancellation technique for MIMO-OFDM wireless network are proposed. Along with interference cancellation technique, adaptive modulation is used to meet the required BER performance by selecting suitable modulation modes based on the channel condition. Doppler assisted channel estimation method is used to estimate the channel. Also, inter channel/carrier interference (ICI) cancellation scheme is used to integrate the parallel interference cancellation together with the decision statistical combining (PIC-DSC) module to detect the data and transmit it to the estimator to iteratively refine the channel and give interference free channel. Simulation results shows that the proposed method improves the BER performance of the system. Copyright © 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

The motivation comes from several applications where the system actuator may introduce a bandwidth limitation, as a result of internal delays, or when the actuator itself is a limited bandwidth closed-loop system. When the traditional UDE approach is applied in these systems, the stability requirements impose a limitation over the effective bandwidth of the UDE filter and therefore disturbances cannot be fully rejected by the filter. In the case where the expected disturbance is periodical with a known fundamental frequency, the proposed UDE filter is designed as a chain of filters to match selected bands of the expected disturbance spectrum and fully reject them while maintaining the desired stability margins. A design example of a power inverter application is investigated and extensive simulation results are provided to verify the proposed UDE filter design. © 2017},

	abstract = {In this paper, the problem of sequential beam construction and adaptive channel estimation based on reduced rank (RR) Kalman filtering for frequency-selective massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems employing single-carrier (SC) in time division duplex (TDD) mode are considered. In two-stage beamforming, a new algorithm for statistical pre-beamformer design is proposed for spatially correlated time-varying wideband MIMO channels under the assumption that the channel is a stationary Gauss-Markov random process. The proposed algorithm yields a nearly optimal pre-beamformer whose beam pattern is designed sequentially with low complexity by taking the user-grouping into account, and exploiting the properties of Kalman filtering and associated prediction error covariance matrices. The resulting design, based on the second order statistical properties of the channel, generates beamspace on which the RR Kalman estimator can be realized as accurately as possible. It is observed that the adaptive channel estimation technique together with the proposed sequential beamspace construction shows remarkable robustness to the pilot interference. This comes with significant reduction in both pilot overhead and dimension of the pre-beamformer lowering both hardware complexity and power consumption. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The CMOS technology has been plagued by several problems in past one decade. The ever increasing power dissipation is the major problem in CMOS circuits and systems. The reversible computing has potential to overcome this problem and reversible logic circuits serve as the backbone in quantum computing. The reversible computing also offers fault diagnostic features. Quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) nanotechnology owing to its unique features like very high operating frequency, extremely low power dissipation, and nanoscale feature size is emerging as a promising candidate to replace CMOS technology. This paper presents design and performance analysis of area efficient QCA based Feynman, Toffoli, and Fredkin universal reversible logic gates. The proposed designs of QCA reversible Feynman, Toffoli, and Fredkin reversible gates utilize 39.62, 21.05, and 24.74% less number of QCA cells as compared to previous best designs. The rectangular layout area of proposed QCA based Feynman, Toffoli, and Fredkin gates are 52, 28.10, and 40.23%, respectively less than previous best designs. The optimized designs are realized employing 5-input majority gates to make proposed designs more compact and area efficient. The major advantage is that the optimized layouts of reversible gates did not utilize any rotated, translated QCA cells, and offer single layer accessibility to their inputs and outputs. The proposed efficient layouts did not employ any coplanar or multi-layer wire crossovers. The energy dissipation results have been computed for proposed area efficient reversible gates and thermal layouts are generated using accurate QCAPro power estimator tool. The functionality of presented designs has been performed in QCADesigner version 2.0.3 tool. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

We propose using variable-bit-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADC) across radio frequency (RF) paths. The combiner designed is a function of the quantization errors across each RF path. Using very low bit resolution ADCs (1-2bits) is a popular approach with massive MIMO receiver architectures to mitigate large power demands. We show that for certain channel conditions, adopting unequal bit resolution ADCs (e.g., between 1 and 4 bits) on different RF chains, along with the proposed combiner, improves the performance of the MIMO receiver in the Mean Squared Error (MSE) sense. The variable-bit-resolution ADCs is still within the power constraint of using equal bit resolution ADCs on all paths (e.g., 2-bits). We propose a genetic algorithm in conjunction with the derived combiner to arrive at an optimal ADC bit allocation framework with significant reduction in computational complexity. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In this work, a low-complexity hardware-friendly discrete Fourier transform (DFT)-based channel estimator with almost no inherent “edge effect” is designed for the long-term evolution (LTE) uplink channel. Specifically, we propose to perform the border symmetric extension (BSE) operation on the border subcarriers of the channel frequency response (CFR), such that the length of the extended CFR fulfills 2⌈log2N⌉, where N denotes the non-radix-2 length of the original CFR, and ⌈ x⌉ stands for the integer ceiling function. Based on the proposed BSE operation, the discontinuities at the CFR’s border subcarriers are significantly lessened and a better power concentration of the transform-domain channel impulse response is realized. As a result, the inherent “edge effect” caused by the virtual subcarriers in LTE systems can be substantially reduced. A further advantage of the proposed method is that the cumbersome application specific integrated circuit-based implementation of 34 different non-radix-2 length DFT/IDFT operations can be accomplished in a single structure by their fast Fourier transform and inverse fast Fourier transform counterparts. Numerical results illustrate that the proposed DFT-based channel estimator with BSE achieves significant performance gains over the conventional counterpart, despite imposing a reduced computational complexity. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

	abstract = {Great increase in wireless access rates might be attainable using the large amount of spectrum available in the millimeter wave (mmWave) band. However, higher propagation losses inherent in these frequencies must be addressed, especially at ranges beyond 100 m and in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) settings. In contrast to the interference limited legacy cellular systems, where using more bandwidth is favorable, to use wider bandwidth for mmWave channels in noise limited settings may be ineffective or even counterproductive when accounting for channel estimation penalty. In this paper, we quantify the maximum beneficial bandwidth for mmWave transmission in some typical deployment scenarios where pilot-based channel estimation penalty is considered assuming a minimum mean square error channel estimator at the receiver. We find that, under I.I.D. block fading model with coherence time $T-{c}$ and coherence bandwidth $B-{c}$ , for transmitters and receivers equipped with a single antenna, the optimal (rate maximizing) signal-to-noise-ratio is a constant that only depends on the product $B-{c}T-{c}$ , which measures the channel coherence and equals the average number of orthogonal symbols per each independent channel coefficient. That is, for fixed channel coherence $B-{c}T-{c}$ , the optimal bandwidth scales linearly with the received signal power. Under 3GPP urban micro NLOS path loss model with coherence time $T-{c}=5$ ms and coherence bandwidth $B-{c}=10$ MHz, using 52-dBm equivalent isotropic radiated power (EIRP) at the transmitter and 11-dBi antenna gain at the receiver, the maximum beneficial bandwidth at 28 (resp. 39) GHz is less than 1 GHz at a distance beyond 210 (resp. 170) m with maximum throughput about 200 Mbps, and less than 100 MHz beyond 400 (resp. 310) m with maximum throughput about 20 Mbps. At EIRP of 85 dBm, corresponding to the FCC limit of 75 dBm per 100 MHz, 1 Gbps rate can be delivered using 1-GHz bandwidth up to 860 (resp. 680) m. © 1983-2012 IEEE.},

Damped transients generated by the growing use of electronically controlled devices are an important source of harmonic distortion of voltage and current waveforms. Accurate real-time estimation of harmonics parameters during the on-line operation of some electric power system is thus an active and pertinent challenging research issue. In this paper a novel on-line algebraic parametric estimation method in time domain, for damped harmonic components on electric power system signals is introduced. Algebraic formulas to directly compute amplitude, damping, frequency and phase parameters and dc offset component into a small time window for variable multi-frequency oscillations are proposed. Parameter estimators enable the on-line and direct reconstruction in finite time of harmonic components and deviations of some measurable signal.

The methodology is tested on a case study where volumes of automatic Frequency Restoration Reserve (aFRR) are forecasted on a day-ahead horizon. It is found that the wind-photovoltaic aggregate can dedicate a limited share of its forecast production to aFRR.

First, the design problem of pilot pattern is casted as a convex optimization. From the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions, the optimal analytical expression is derived when source and RS powers are given or fixed. Second, under the total transmit power sum constraint of source node and RS, an optimal power allocation (OPA) strategy is proposed to further alleviate the effect of Sum-MSE. Simulation results show that the proposed OPA performs better than equal power allocation (EPA) in terms of Sum-MSE, and the Sum-MSE performance gain increases with deviating ρ from the value of ρo minimizing the Sum-MSE, where ρ is defined as the average ratio of the residual SI channel gain at RS to the intended channel gain from source to RS. For example, the OPA achieves approximately 5-dB signal-to-noise ratio gain over EPA by shrinking or stretching ρ with a factor 4. More importantly, the more ρ decreases or increases, the more the performance gain becomes significant. © 2013 IEEE.},

In addition, based on the transformed signal, a simple adaptive algorithm for frequency estimation is proposed. Beside the proposed approach, any frequency estimator designed for a single-Tone complex exponential can be used here, which is also the advantage of the proposed method. Simulation results confirm that the proposed algorithm exhibits better performance compared to the considered algorithms. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Nonlinear processors are always used to mitigate impulsive noises (IN) in power-line communication systems and seem to work well. However, it depends on two important assumptions: first, prior knowledge of noise statistics is provided; secondly, to assume the channel estimation result is ideal, which are both not easy to achieve. Based on this situation, the paper proposed a noise-suppression method joints blanking and robust channel estimation. The blanking works as a preprocessor ahead of the channel estimation, which filters the serious impulsive noise out. While in the channel estimation, the simplified M-estimator is applied to suit the IN-polluted signal distribution, which can ease the effect induced by the deviation of the 'optimal' threshold value during nonlinear processing, but also returns a more accurate estimation, embodied with lower bit error rate (BER) in the simulation. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Passive radio-frequency identification (RFID) systems carry critical importance for Internet of Things (IoT) applications due to their energy harvesting capabilities. RFID-based position estimation, in particular, is expected to facilitate a wide array of location-based services for IoT applications with low-power requirements. In this paper, considering monostatic and bistatic configurations and 3-D antenna radiation pattern, we investigate the accuracy of received signal strength-based wireless localization using passive ultra high frequency RFID systems. The Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the localization accuracy is derived, and is compared with the accuracy of maximum likelihood estimators for various RFID antenna configurations. Numerical results show that due to RFID tag/antenna sensitivity, and the directional antenna pattern, the localization accuracy can degrade at blind locations that remain outside of the RFID reader antennas' main beam patterns. In such cases optimizing elevation angle of antennas are shown to improve localization coverage, while using bistatic configuration improves localization accuracy significantly. © 2014 IEEE.},

We establish first-order asymptotic validity of the resulting bootstrap power variations, activity index estimator, and diffusion tests for H0. Moreover, the finite sample size and power properties of the proposed diffusion tests are compared to those of benchmark tests using Monte Carlo simulations. Unlike existing procedures, our bootstrap tests are correctly sized in general settings.

	abstract = {This paper presents a new centralized adaptive underfrequency load shedding controller that is integrated with a distribution state estimator to improve the frequency stability of islanded microgrids. While underfrequency load shedding is a well-established corrective emergency frequency-control action, it is not entirely suitable for use in microgrids with low inertia and a limited number of measurement devices. The novel centralized controller presented in this paper overcomes these challenges by incorporating a distribution state estimator to estimate the power consumption of the demand. In parallel to this, the actual active power imbalance in the microgrid is estimated by simultaneously monitoring the system frequency and its rate of change. The centralized controller uses these two variables to determine the correct amount of load to be shed. The performance of the proposed controller has been validated using computer simulations of the actual distribution network in Malaysia. These simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed centralized controller for preventing power system instabilities, which might lead to cascading outages and even a complete blackout in microgrids that have been disconnected/islanded, from the main grid. © 1986-2012 IEEE.},

We also present a schema for frequency and contention-aware thread-to-core assignment (FACTS) which considers various thread demands. The proposed solution (RePP-C) selects a given hardware configuration for each active core to ensure that the performance-power demands are satisfied while using the scheduling schema (FACTS) for mapping threads-to-cores. Our results show that FACTS improves over other state-of-the-art schedulers like Distributed Intensity Online (DIO) and native Linux scheduler by 8.25% and 37.56% in performance, with simultaneous improvement in energy efficiency by 6.2% and 14.17%, respectively. Moreover, we prove the usability of RePP-C by predicting performance and power for 7 different types of workloads and 10 different QoS targets.

To validate this wind farm control algorithm, a relatively high fidelity wind farm simulation tool developed in the previous study was modified to include a wind farm controller which consists of a wind speed estimator, a power command calculator and a simplified wind farm model. In addition, the wind turbine controller in the simulation tool was modified to include a demanded power tracking algorithm. For a virtual wind farm with three 5 MW wind turbines aligned with the wind, simulations were performed with various ambient turbulent intensities, turbine spacing, and control frequencies.

	abstract = {Control of the natural resonance frequency of an RF cavity is essential for accelerator structures due to their high cavity sensitivity to internal and external vibrations and the dependency of resonant frequency on temperature changes. Due to the relatively high radio frequencies involved (MHz to GHz), direct measurement of the resonant frequency for real-time control is not possible by using conventional microcontroller hardware. So far, all operational cavities are tuned using phase comparison techniques. The temperature dependent phase measurements render this technique labor and time intensive. To eliminate the phase measurement, reduce man hours and speed up cavity start up time, this paper presents a control theme that relies solely on the reflected power measurement. The control algorithm for the nonlinear system is developed through Lyapunov's method. The controller stabilizes the resonance frequency of the cavity using a nonlinear control algorithm in combination with a gradient estimation method. Experimental results of the proposed system on a test cavity show that the resonance frequency can be tuned to its optimum operating point while the start up time of a single cavity and the accompanied man hours are significantly decreased. A test result of the fully commissioned control system on one of TRIUMF's DTL tanks verifies its performance under real environmental conditions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {In order to achieve a good dynamical response of a full-bridge AC-DC voltage source converters (VSC). The bandwidth of PI controller must be relatively wide. This leads to the voltage ripple produced in the control signal, as known that its ripple frequency has twice of the line frequency and cause the 3rd harmonic of an input current. A Ripple Voltage Estimator (RVE) algorithm and Feed-Forward Compensation (FFC) algorithm are proposed and added to the conventional control. The RVE algorithm estimated the ripple signal to subtract it occurring in the voltage loop. As a result, the 3rd harmonic of the input current can be reduced, and hence the Total Harmonic Distortion of input current (THDi) are improved. In addition, the FFC algorithm will offer a better dynamical response of output voltage. The performance evaluation was conducted through the simulation and experiment at 110Vrms/50Hz of the input voltage, with a 600 W load and 250 Vdc output voltage. The overall system performances are obtained as follows: the power factor at the full load is higher 0.98, the harmonic distortion at AC input power source of the converter is under control in IEC61000-3-2 class A limit, and the overall efficiency is greater than 85%. © 2017 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Following the establishment of a large signal model of microgrid, an adaptive sliding mode observer is allocated to each distributed generation unit to estimate the transient responses of the other units based on the coupling of the physical system. In this way, the proposed secondary control is implemented in a fully decentralised structure such that each distributed generation requires its own information only; unlike conventional centralised or distributed control methods, this scheme obviates any requirement for communication network and remote measurements, which leads to improved system reliability, flexibility and scalability.

Many of such frequency domain methods, such as Basic Frequency Domain (BFD), Frequency Domain Decomposition (FFD), or Enhanced Frequency Domain Decomposition (EFFD), use as first step a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) estimate of the power spectral density (PSD) associated with the response of the system. In this study it is shown that higher order statistical estimators such as Spectral Kurtosis (SK) and Sample to Model Ratio (SMR) may be successfully employed not only to more reliably discriminate the response of the system against the ambient noise fluctuations, but also to better identify and separate contributions from closely spaced individual modes. It is shown that a SMR-based Maximum Likelihood curve fitting algorithm may improve the accuracy of the spectral shape and location of the individual modes and, when combined with the SK analysis, it provides efficient means to categorize such individual spectral components according to their temporal dynamics as coherent or incoherent system responses to unknown ambient excitations. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This paper presents the experimental results of a velocity feedback control of a vibrating plate, excited by a random point force. The control unit consists of a sensor collocated with an inertial actuator. The inertial actuator is driven with a current proportional to the measured velocity of the structure. For this control system, an optimal feedback gain exists, which minimises the time-averaged kinetic energy of the global structure. By increasing the gain beyond the optimal gain, the performance of the active control system does not improve and the feedback is less effective, since the boundary conditions can change due to the pinning. In order to define an equivalent performance estimator, which can be locally measured, the time-averaged power absorbed by the inertial actuator for different values of feedback gain is investigated. In this study, a frequency-domain analysis of the control system is presented. A load cell is added between the structure and the actuator, so that the control force generated by the control unit can be measured, and hence the power absorbed can be estimated. It is shown that, as the feedback gain increases, the time-averaged power absorbed increases to a maximum value, whereas the local velocity of the structure decreases.},

	abstract = {The past few years have witnessed a tremendous development in power-line communications (PLCs) for the realization of smart grids. Since power lines were not originally intended for conveying high-frequency signals, any communication over these lines would be exposed to severe adversarial factors, such as interference, impulsive, and phase noise. This elucidates the importance of employing robust modulation techniques and motivates research in this direction. Indeed, the aim of this brief is to propose a differential chaos shift keying (DCSK) modulation scheme as a potential candidate for smart grid communication networks. This DCSK class of noncoherent modulation is very robust against linear and nonlinear channel distortions. More importantly, the demodulation process can be carried out without any channel estimator at the receiver side. In this work, we analyze the bit error rate performance of DCSK over multipath PLC channels in which phase, background, and impulsive noise are present. A simulator is developed to verify the performance of the proposed DCSK against direct sequence code division multiple access and direct sequence differential phase shift keying. The results presented in this work prove the advantages of this low-cost noncoherent modulation technique for PLC systems over its rivals. © 2016 IEEE.},

In addition, a target standard deviational ellipse is proposed, using predefined values for a target frequency bound and the area's frequency bias. The presented approach is based on the accordance of the estimated ellipse with the target ellipse, resulting in several grades for the LFC performance.

Parametric maps were created to visualize QUS parameter variation in plaque. Histopathology examination was reported for a representative section of fixed plaque. Plaque was scored for hemorrhage, hemosiderin, and inflammation on an ordinal scale and was assessed for percent cholesterol/fibrinoid and calcium. Relationships between QUS parameters and histopathology were examined. Our results indicate that plaques with more calcium on histopathology (n=2, >20% calcium) have high IB (approaching 0 dB) and elevated AC (approaching 1.5 dB/cm-MHz). Plaques with high percent cholesterol/fibrinoid (n=4, >60% cholesterol/fibrinoid) have low IB (approaching -30 dB) and moderate AC (approaching 1 dB/cm-MHz). We are also able to distinguish calcified and soft plaque regions on parametric maps. These findings suggest that IB and AC can be used to noninvasively evaluate plaques based on tissue composition. Thus, these QUS parameters may provide important information for a risk-assessment model of carotid plaque. Future work will compare QUS parameters in-vivo with high frequency characterizations of plaque ex-vivo and 3D reconstructions of histopathology sections. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Impulsive noise in power lines usually bears higher power spectral density than the background noise. Even a sample of such noise, if not mitigated, destroys symbols in all the subcarriers affecting channel estimation and information detection. In this paper, we study two maximum-likelihood approaches to estimate the channel in the presence of impulsive noise for an OFDM based PLC system. In both approaches, we approximate the impulsive noise first and use it to determine the channel frequency response. In the first approach, we assume the estimated noise to be random and perform the channel estimation assuming that its statistics are given. In the second approach, the impulsive noise is assumed to be deterministic and the channel frequency response is determined after proper subtraction from the observations. As will be shown by simulation results, the estimator that assumes noise to be random generally performs better than the one that treats the estimated impulsive noise as a deterministic quantity. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Frequency offset (FO) introduces severe inter-symbol and inter-carrier interferences which will degrade the performances of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system more adversely. To reduce the effect of CFO, an estimation algorithm has been proposed in this work which uses a turbo coding at the precoding section and Space time block coding techniques (alamouti code) for transmitting data. The turbo codes solve dilemma of structure and randomness through concatenation and interleaving and it will reduce bit error rate (BER) by error detection and error correction process. A fading channel has been modeled for evaluating the performance of the algorithm. Maximum likelihood (ML) estimation is used for the estimation that does take conditional probability into account. The offset estimation in OFDM is done by best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE) principle yet it has disadvantages that it is already sub optimal in nature and it is applicable only for linear observation models. So, ML technique is an alternative estimation criterion that can use as starting point of most of the statistical estimation and for nonlinear observations. The proposed system has improved BER while other methods supports BER of 25-30 dB and the proposed system shows improvement in spectral efficiency as well as the Power spectral density. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The phasor measurement unit (PMU) commonly implements enhanced discrete Fourier transformation (EDFT) to compensate leakage and signal discontinuity errors at offnominal frequencies. However, EDFT results in a high total vector error (TVE) at large offnominal frequency and worsens with harmonics in power signals. Although the sample value adjustment (SVA) technique addressed such demerits, it generates an asymmetrical TVE profile. In addition, the frequency estimator was not taken into account in the previous publication on SVA. This paper proposes an improved sample value adjustment (ISVA) as a pre-DFT technique to further enhance the phasor estimation. The ISVA generates a symmetrical TVE profile and performed better than EDFT, SVA, and Taylor weighted least-square method at steady-state conditions. Subsequently, the ISVA is integrated with a recursive least-square frequency estimator, which enabled it to track dynamic signals as well. The algorithm is validated in MATLAB simulation and in a prototyped PMU. Static and dynamic test signals are based on the IEEE C37.118.1a-2014 standard. © 1986-2012 IEEE.},

The signal model assumes a deterministic target signal in Gaussian clutter and noise. In estimation theory, the CRLB provides a lower bound on the achievable variance of any unbiased estimator. An estimator that achieves this bound is called efficient; however, there is no guarantee that an efficient estimator can be found. Nonetheless, the theoretical variance of the efficient estimator provides a good measure of the capability of the system and serves as a valuable system performance validation tool. Even if an efficient estimator cannot be found, for radar systems, the CRLB provides a necessary, but not sufficient design baseline for measurement parameters, such as the number of subapertures for transmit and receive, power levels, pulse-repetition frequency, and so on. CRLBs for a limited number of system configurations for RADARSAT-2 and TerraSAR-X are presented by Cerutti-Maori et al. and Ender et al.; however, the complete analytical form of CRLB for a general system, which can be readily applied to an arbitrary antenna switching configuration, has not been previously derived. © 1980-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Hybrid analog/digital precoding is a promising technique to reduce the hardware cost of radio-frequency components compared with the conventional full-digital precoding approach in millimeter-wave multiple-input multiple output systems. However, the large antenna dimensions of the hybrid precoder design makes it difficult to acquire an optimal full-digital precoder. Moreover, it also requires matrix inversion, which leads to high complexity in the hybrid precoder design. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity optimal full-digital precoder acquisition algorithm, named beamspace singular value decomposition (SVD) that saves power for the base station and user equipment. We exploit reduced-dimension beamspace channel state information (CSI) given by compressive sensing (CS) based channel estimators. Then, we propose a CS-assisted beamspace hybrid precoding (CS-BHP) algorithm that leverages CS-based CSI. Simulation results show that the proposed beamspace-SVD reduces complexity by 99.4% compared with an optimal full-digital precoder acquisition using full-dimension SVD. Furthermore, the proposed CS-BHP reduces the complexity of the state-of-the-art approach by 99.6% and has less than 5% performance loss compared with an optimal full-digital precoder. © 1991-2012 IEEE.},

A novel motor flux estimator based on phase-locked loop and proportional-integral (PI) regulator is proposed in this paper. This estimator calculates the set point of the torque component of electromotive force (EMF) through synchronous frequency and flux. Then, errors between the set point and the actual value of the EMF torque component are corrected by PI regulator to estimate the flux. This method avoids the problem of the saturation brought by the traditional integrator and the problem of the initial phase error. It also solves the magnitude and phase error problems at low speed in the flux estimator based on the low-pass filter. Finally, the simulation and the experiments are implemented on a cycloconverter-fed motor drive system to verify the effectiveness of this method. Simulation results show that this algorithm works very well at 0.2 Hz, and experimental results show that this algorithm can work well at 0.5 Hz. Meanwhile, this algorithm could detect the initial position of the rotor of separately excited synchronous motor. © 2017, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {The future generation of transportation system will be featured by electrified public transportation. To fulfill metropolitan transit demands, electric vehicles (EVs) must be continuously operable without recharging downtime. Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) techniques for in-motion EV charging is a solution. It however brings up a challenge: how to deploy charging lanes in a metropolitan road network to minimize the deployment cost while enabling EVs' continuous operability. In this paper, we propose CatCharger, which is the first work that handles this challenge. From a metropolitan-scale dataset collected from multiple sources of vehicles, we observe the diversity of vehicle passing speed and daily visit frequency (called traffic attributes) at intersections (i.e., landmarks), which are important factors for charging lane deployment. To select landmarks for deployment, we first group landmarks with similar traffic attribute values using the entropy minimization clustering method, and choose better candidate landmarks from each group suitable for deployment. To determine the deployment locations from the candidate landmarks, we infer the expected vehicle residual energy at each landmark using a Kernel Density Estimator fed by the vehicles' mobility, and formulate and solve an optimization problem to minimize the total deployment cost while ensuring a certain level of expected residual energy of EVs at each landmark. Our trace-driven experiments demonstrate the superior performance of CatCharger over other methods. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Control of a distributed power system (DPS) is a challenging task and requires unique control formulation as they arise in complex engineering problems. Since DPSs are gaining widespread importance, development of robust control strategies, which encompasses the nonlinear behavior and spatial spread of such networks, commands utmost gravity. Due to the spatial spread of such networks, state observer design based on local state variables plays a role of paramount importance. In this paper, the authors have outlined the design of a non-linear state observer which will aid a distributed control architecture for a single-input multi-output high frequency distributed power system (HFDPS) which incorporates need-based asynchronous power transfer. An adaptive control strategy for independent control of the need-based asynchronous HFDPS will be implemented based on the estimated state variables of the observer. Hence global control objectives are addressed using local sensing and a robust estimator design. Experimental results are portrayed in order to verify the stability and robust dynamic performance of the observer so designed. The nonlinear state observer was designed in the framework of exact formulation based on nonlinear map. Hence the observer encompasses the impact of switching frequency and other fast scale dynamics without any bandwidth limitation. © 2017 IEEE.},

We also estimate the mutual information of the system with no CSIR, from which we compute the SNR gains that CSIR obtains. The results show that partial CSIR achieves the majority of the potential SNR gain for a given performance level. We consequently design a peak energy detector to estimate the interfered sub- carrier for a practical system and test the performance of the estimator both as a function of the interference dwell time and as a function of the interference power. The results indicate that longer dwell times enable the estimator to approach the performance of a genie-aided system and that a trade-off for increasing interference power exists between ease of detection and harm caused by missed detections. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Frequency stabilized light sources with narrow linewidth are mandatory for atom interferometry based experiments. For compact experiment designs used on space platforms, tunable DFB diode lasers are often used. These lasers combine low energy consumption with small sizes, but lack long-term frequency stability. This paper presents an FPGA based laser frequency stabilization system for highly variable target frequencies using frequency modulated Rb-spectroscopy achieving latencies below 100 μs. The system consists of a DFB laser, a Rb-spectroscopy cell, a laser current controller and an FPGA board with an analog-digital conversion board. The digital part of the frequency stabilization system is a SoC mapped on an FPGA. The SoC consists of a processor, enabling user interaction via network connection, and the dedicated frequency stabilization module. This module consists of a demodulation stage, digital filters, a frequency estimator and a controller. To estimate the frequency, small ramps of the laser frequency are generated using a high-speed DAC connected to the laser current controller. The absorption spectroscopy output of this beam is sampled using a photodiode and a high-speed ADC. After signal conditioning with digital filters, the frequency estimator extracts the present mid-frequency of the laser applying pattern matching with a prerecorded reference spectrum. The frequency controller adjusts the mean laser current based on this estimation. The performance as well as the accuracy of the proposed laser stabilization system and its FPGA resource and power consumption are evaluated. © 2018 SPIE.},

In this paper, we drop the assumption of receiver calibration, leading to biased measurements for each node. We model these bias effects as additive random variables for each receiver in the log-distance path loss model. We propose two novel estimators to handle these effects as modifications of the nonlinear least squares and the Gaussian particle filter algorithms. The estimators are augmented using the principle of variance least squares, in which the biases' effect on the data covariance is estimated online. These estimates inform subsequent iterations of the nonlinear algorithms. The path loss exponent and emitter power offset are likewise treated as unknowns. Our simulations show the performance improvement evident in various scenarios over the naive approaches, other contemporary algorithms, and with respect to the Cramér-Rao lower bound. We further show the efficacy of our approach through several experiments using real RSS data collected from a mobile network. © 2017 IEEE.},

Cyber malfunction and faults can be emerged as unknown input disturbances in power systems.

	abstract = {Getting a high range resolution is an important issue in many research areas and applications especially for narrowband system. Although wideband systems have a better condition from this viewpoint, they have additional challenges in terms of cost and RF manufacturing. Thus, overcoming the bandwidth constraint on the resolution can be a game changer in the simplicity and feasibility aspects of a system. In this paper, an accurate and efficient approach for high resolution range measurement is proposed. An ultra-wideband (UWB) M-sequence system is established for its simplicity and cost effectiveness compared to other methods like frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) and impulse technique. However, the limited usable bandwidth in the power spectrum of an M-sequence signal degrades its resolution. We have alleviated this shortcoming by applying a Least squares (LS) estimator to improve the resolution and accuracy of the system. The acceptable performance of the presented method is verified experimentally and numerically by achieving 45% improvement in the resolution with the accuracy of more than 95%. By considering the effects of different parameters such as response of antenna, method of scan and systematic errors, the proposed method would be a good candidate for remote sensing applications. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology.},

	abstract = {Objective: A characteristic of neurological signal processing is high levels of noise from subcellular ion channels up to whole-brain processes. In this paper, we propose a new model of electroencephalogram (EEG) background periodograms, based on a family of functions which we call generalized van der Ziel-McWhorter (GVZM) power spectral densities (PSDs). To the best of our knowledge, the GVZM PSD function is the only EEG noise model that has relatively few parameters, matches recorded EEG PSD's with high accuracy from 0 to over 30 Hz, and has approximately 1/fθ behavior in the midfrequencies without infinities. Methods: We validate this model using three approaches. First, we show how GVZM PSDs can arise in a population of ion channels at maximum entropy equilibrium. Second, we present a class of mixed autoregressive models, which simulate brain background noise and whose periodograms are asymptotic to the GVZM PSD. Third, we present two real-time estimation algorithms for steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) frequencies, and analyze their performance statistically. Results: In pairwise comparisons, the GVZM-based algorithms showed statistically significant accuracy improvement over two well-known and widely used SSVEP estimators. Conclusion: The GVZM noise model can be a useful and reliable technique for EEG signal processing. Significance: Understanding EEG noise is essential for EEG-based neurology and applications such as real-time brain-computer interfaces, which must make accurate control decisions from very short data epochs. The GVZM approach represents a successful new paradigm for understanding and managing this neurological noise. © 1964-2012 IEEE.},

Through these results we have verified that the developed technique is capable of offering interesting results at classifying power quality (PQ) disturbance.

	abstract = {Categorical models are a natural fit for many problems. When learning the distribution of categories from samples, high-dimensionality may dilute the data. Minimax optimality is too pessimistic to remedy this issue. A serendipitously discovered estimator, absolute discounting, corrects empirical frequencies by subtracting a constant from observed categories, which it then redistributes among the unobserved. It outperforms classical estimators empirically, and has been used extensively in natural language modeling. In this paper, we rigorously explain the prowess of this estimator using less pessimistic notions. We show that (1) absolute discounting recovers classical minimax KL-risk rates, (2) it is adaptive to an effective dimension rather than the true dimension, (3) it is strongly related to the Good-Turing estimator and inherits its competitive properties. We use power-law distributions as the cornerstone of these results. We validate the theory via synthetic data and an application to the Global Terrorism Database. © 2017 Neural information processing systems foundation. All rights reserved.},

Then, digital predistortion of the nonlinear power amplifier may be too expensive. In order to investigate the feasibility of receiver-side compensation of the transmitter RF impairments, we study joint maximum-likelihood estimation of channel and clipping level in multipath fading OFDM systems. In particular, we propose an alternative optimization algorithm, which uses frequency-domain block-type training symbols, and prove that this algorithm always converges, at least to a local optimum point. Then, we calculate the Cramér-Rao lower bound, and show that the proposed estimator attains it for high signal-to-noise ratios. Finally, we perform numerical evaluations to illustrate the performance of the estimator, and show that iterative decoding can be done using the estimated channel and clipping level with almost the same performance as a genie-aided scenario, where the channel and clipping level are perfectly known. © 1991-2012 IEEE.},

A recent solution based on a coexistence paradigm offers some RFI- free durations for RAS but further expansion of RAS observation faces with strong RFI. To enhance spectrum access opportunities for both wireless communications and RAS, we explore a new approach where both systems simultaneously access the spectrum for some durations and RAS exploits RFI cancellation. The main challenge is nonlinear distortion caused by strong RFI. We study this nonlinearity's effect on RAS observation performance and develop a nonlinear-RFI cancellation scheme and a modified RAS signal power estimation scheme. We also design a channel estimator for the nonlinear system based on the unscented Kalman filter. Simulation results in flat stationary channels and multipath Rayleigh fading channels show the proposed approach yields a great improvement in RAS signal power estimation performance even at strong RFI levels. © 2017 IEEE.},

This work presents an impedance estimation technique implemented in real time.

The small current disturbance is a Modified Morlet Wavelet waveform and a sequential of small waves, each one centered in a harmonic frequency is injected in the network. In order to quantify the impact of the sequential waves injection in the power quality a new factor is defined, named Root Mean Square Ratio (RMSR).

There have been many studies on phasor estimation techniques under dynamic and transient conditions. Although the performance under dynamic conditions of estimators based on the static phasor model has improved, significant errors still exist during large dynamic deviations. Two fast and precise dynamic phasor estimation algorithms under power system oscillations and off-nominal frequency conditions are described in this paper. The methods use the signal model under these dynamic conditions, linearize them by using Taylor's series expansion, and estimate the phasor using least squares technique. Frequency and its rate of change are also calculated using adjacent phasors with minimum complexity. Results obtained show that the performance errors of the proposed methods are way below the minimum requirement of the standard and better than other similar dynamic phasor algorithms. © 2015 IEEE.},

The imbalance between the voltages in an unbalanced system results in significant performance degradation. We address this problem by generalising the Clarke transformation to the case where the voltages are not equal. We then propose a new simple yet accurate algorithm for the estimation of the frequency.

	abstract = {Most communications systems require channel estimation for equalization and symbol detection. Currently, this is achieved by using dedicated pilot symbols, which consume a non-negligible part of the throughput and power resources, especially for large dimensional systems. The main objective of this paper is to quantify the rate of reduction of this overhead due to the use of a semi-blind channel estimation. Different data models and different pilot design schemes have been considered in this paper. By using the Cramér Rao Bound (CRB) tool, the estimation error variance bounds of the pilot-based and semi-blind based channel estimators for a multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) system are compared. In particular, for large MIMO-OFDM systems, a direct computation of the CRB is prohibitive, and hence, a dedicated numerical technique for its fast computation has been developed. Many key observations have been made from this comparative study. The most important one is that, thanks to the semi-blind approach, one can skip about 95% of the pilot samples without affecting the channel estimation quality. © 2002-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The fluctuation in contact force between the pantograph and the catenary severely affects the current collection quality of electric multiple units in high-speed railway. In particular, when double pantographs operate simultaneously, the contact force on trailing pantograph (TP) fluctuates violently due to the passage of leading pantograph (LP). To address this problem, a prior-information-based finite-frequency textH ∞controller, incorporating an adaptive estimator, is proposed for the active control of double pantographs in this paper. As the prior information is of great importance, the frequency characteristics of contact force are analyzed based on power spectrum density and utilized in calculating the control gain matrix. The finite-frequency control is employed to decrease the contact force fluctuation within the concerned frequency range with limited control force. Considering the unknown and time-varying noise statistic, an adaptive cubature Kalman filter is presented to estimate the states of pantographs. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed control strategy are evaluated with implementations in a nonlinear double-pantograph-catenary system model under different operational conditions. The results show that, for both LP and TP, the control strategy can adequately decrease the contact force fluctuation. Particularly, it has a good capability to reject parameter perturbations and external disturbance. © 1967-2012 IEEE.},

Quantization of muscle fatigue needs to be defined clearly so that it can be used as an indicator or a compensator in the control system. Electromyography signal which is produced during dynamic motion during muscle fatigue assessment is a non-stationary signal. In this study, the discrete wavelet transforms method was used to analyze electromyography signals. The electromyography signal was decomposed up to 5th scale. Features extraction, root mean square, mean average, standard deviation and power signal were used to observe the correlation coefficient and the slope of the regression line. Our finding from the results of the analysis with multi-resolution discrete wavelet transforms showed that the frequency ranged 62.5 Hz up to 125 Hz was the dominant frequency of the EMG signal and feature of power was better among other features to observe the muscle fatigue. In this study, the correlation coefficient was 0.852 and the best slope was 0.728 mV/s. These value can also be used as an indicator or an estimator of the state of the fatigue and used as a compensator in the system based myoelectric control. © 2016 IEEE.},

The cooperative relay communication system takes advantage of the broadcast nature of the wireless channel to improve the communication between the source node and a destination node with the aid of one or more relay nodes. The system harnesses the new form of spatial diversity and combat multipath fading, thereby improving the spectral efficiency, and reducing the transmission error, system outages, and transmission power. OFDM modulated system is used for the implementation of cooperative communication system in MATLAB®. The estimator makes use of two identical halves property of time synchronization preamble used in OFDM systems and relies on autocorrelation of the same. The current estimator is compared with SISO SNR estimation method in-terms of normalized mean square error (NMSE) and estimated SNR.

	abstract = {Objective. Mental workload is frequently estimated by EEG-based mental state monitoring systems. Usually, these systems use spectral markers and event-related potentials (ERPs). To our knowledge, no study has directly compared their performance for mental workload assessment, nor evaluated the stability in time of these markers and of the performance of the associated mental workload estimators. This study proposes a comparison of two processing chains, one based on the power in five frequency bands, and one based on ERPs, both including a spatial filtering step (respectively CSP and CCA), an FLDA classification and a 10-fold cross-validation. Approach. To get closer to a real life implementation, spectral markers were extracted from a short window (i.e. towards reactive systems) that did not include any motor activity and the analyzed ERPs were elicited by a task-independent probe that required a reflex-like answer (i.e. close to the ones required by dead man's vigilance devices). The data were acquired from 20 participants who performed a Sternberg memory task for 90 min (i.e. 2/6 digits to memorize) inside which a simple detection task was inserted. The results were compared both when the testing was performed at the beginning and end of the session. Main results. Both chains performed significantly better than random; however the one based on the spectral markers had a low performance (60%) and was not stable in time. Conversely, the ERP-based chain gave very high results (91%) and was stable in time. Significance. This study demonstrates that an efficient and stable in time workload estimation can be achieved using task-independent spatially filtered ERPs elicited in a minimally intrusive manner. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Since multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) is a promising technology to fully exploit the channel capacity in mobile radio network, this paper investigates the uplink transmission of SC-FDMA systems with orthogonal space frequency block codes (SFBC). It is necessary to joint consider the channel estimation, multiuser detection and turbo equalization for MU-MIMO SC-FDMA system. The pipelined turbo equalizer architecture has the feature that multiple soft-decisions become available at various processing stage. These multiple decisions from different pipeline stage have varying levels of reliability and can be used to track the variation of the channels. A critical issue in turbo receiver design is long processing latency due to inherent iterative processing of information. Pipeline architecture reduces the latency and improves processing throughput in turbo receivers and thus is the prevailing choice of the implementation architecture. The optimum channel estimator is a Kalman-based channel estimator for MU-MIMO SC-FDMA systems. In this paper, we use the pipelined structure to design the iterative channel tracking, multiuser detection and turbo equalization which with low latency, reasonable computation complexity and good channel tracking capability. Some simulation examples for uplink scenario are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes. © 2015 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This study is conducted aiming to identify the dynamics of a tapered beam, embedded by piezoelectric layer. Narrowing the tip of the beam equipped with piezoelectric patches leads to optimize the output power after excitation by the frequency sweep input. An accelerometer is installed on the beam base, which measures the acceleration that is applied to the system. Piezoelectric sensors also measure the generated voltage. The experimental test data is handled through CIFER software, using Fourier transform and Bode plot in the frequency domain, to obtain appropriate transfer functions. MATLAB is used for nonlinear simulation and validation of discrete transfer functions by a set of data that is different from the identification data and the error value is computed. Least square estimator and ARX1 function are also employed in order to evaluate the derived transfer function in time domain. © 2016 IEEE.},

However, the PWM based driver circuits working at very high frequencies are prone to the external noise signals. The consequence of presence of uncertainties may result in peculiar, erratic and unpredictable behavior of system. This paper intends to capture the effect of switching uncertainties in a nonisolated Cuk converter using two powerful results of Mathematics for the first time as author understands it, namely classical Euler-Lagrangian equations and the theory of stochastic estimation and filtering. This results in more accurate model of the converter which captures the behaviour of uncertainties in the switching gateway and the estimator may be used by design engineers to design more accurate controller when operating in closed loop. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a novel blind carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimation is proposed on the basis of the linearly constrained optimization for the uplink transmission of space–time block-coded multicarrier code division multiple access systems. First, the full-dimensional spatial-and-temporal data are formed to avoid violation of the second-order statistics in the conventional receiver design. A set of weight vectors is then provided for acquiring each multipath signal from the desired user while the others get rejected. Finally, the estimated CFO is obtained in accordance with maximizing the well-defined measurement function, which is formulated by collecting all the output powers of the receiver. A space–time averaging technique is also proposed to enhance the robustness to the finite sample effect. Simulation study confirms that with the proposed CFO estimator used in the preceding, the receiver can successfully achieve the same performance of the optimal receiver working in the absence of CFO.

	abstract = {This paper presents a voltage perturbation control strategy in weak microgrid, which is able to use a voltage estimator to perform voltage feed-forward control. The proposed control strategy is embedded in voltage source inverter (VSI) and provides supplementary control in power-voltage control system. When a series of parameters perturbation occur, the output voltage waveform of VSI would be distorted, at the same time, the amplitude error and the phase error as compared to microgrid voltage would appear. As the amount of perturbation cannot be obtained directly through measurement, an estimator is used to calculate this perturbation in order to realize feed-forward compensation for the perturbation component. Finally, VSI output voltage amplitude, frequency and phase are the same as those of microgrid at the point of common coupling. Therefore, the distributed generator through VSI can be connected without phase locked loop. Furthermore, the robustness of the control system is investigated under parameters' variation. The simulation and experimental results show that the smooth transition is achieved when a DG is connected or disconnected from the islanded microgrid. © 2015 IEEE.},

	abstract = {A closed-form expression for the normalized variance of the fluctuations induced by cross-phase modulation (XPM) in direct-detection (DD) double-sideband (DSB) orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems is proposed and validated. This expression is obtained by adapting the analytical model for XPM-induced intensity-modulated fluctuations derived in the past for conventional on-off keying systems to DSB-OFDM systems employing DD receivers. It is shown that the normalized variance can be used as an error vector magnitude (EVM) estimator in DD DSB-OFDM systems dominantly impaired by XPM. This conclusion is drawn after validating the proposed closed-form expression in two application scenarios: 1) distribution of DSB-OFDM ultra-wideband signals using a radio-over-fiber infrastructure, and 2) transmission of 10 Gb/s DSB-OFDM signals in access networks. Excellent accuracy between the EVM estimates provided by the normalized variance expression and the actual EVM of the OFDM system is demonstrated through numerical simulation for a large set of system parameters. When the carrier-to-signal power ratio (CSPR) is high, an EVM discrepancy not exceeding 0.3 dB is obtained in most of the analyzed cases. When the CSPR decreases to 0 dB, the discrepancy between the actual EVM and the normalized variance does not exceed 0.5 dB. A maximum discrepancy between the actual EVM and the normalized variance around 1 dB is also shown when the spectral occupancy of the DSB-OFDM signal leads to a dispersion-induced power fading in the most affected subcarrier as high as 20 dB. These results suggest that the proposed closed-form expression is a powerful tool to provide fast and accurate estimates of the XPM-limited capacity of wavelength division multiplexing DSB-OFDM systems employing direct detection. © 2009-2012 OSA.},

Among various channel estimation methods, the discrete Fourier transform (DFT)-based channel estimation is favored because it has simple architecture and shows as good performance as the linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimation method. However, the DFT itself has its own complexity which should be overcome to achieve high speed operation as well as simple implementation.

However, understanding of the most appropriate VE protocols is lacking, limiting the optimal use of VE in rehabilitation programs. In this study, the fatiguing effect of vibration at different frequencies was investigated by employing a force-modulation VE system. Twenty volunteers performed 12-s isometric contractions of the biceps brachii with a load consisting of a baseline force of 80% of their maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) and a superimposed sinusoidal force at 0 (control condition with no vibration), 20, 30, and 40 Hz. Mechanical fatigue was estimated by assessment of MVC decay after each task while myoelectric fatigue was estimated by analysis of multichannel electromyography (EMG) signals recorded during VE. EMG conduction velocity, spectral compression, power, and fractal dimension were estimated as indicators of myoelectric fatigue. Our results suggest vibration, in particular at 30 Hz, to produce a larger degree of fatigue as compared to control condition. These results motivate further research aiming at introducing VE in rehabilitation programs with improved training protocols. © 2001-2011 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Renewable energy systems have become very popular in recent years. The quality of power produced in such systems has to fulfill the requirements defined in the respective standards. The power control process is based on the frequency, amplitude and phase estimation of the grid signal. Recently, a fast and accurate estimation method was presented. The method is based on the FFT procedure and 3-point spectrum interpolation. It is not computationally complex and it reduces the impact of the conjugate component on the results. Estimates can be obtained in time that is much shorter than one cycle of the grid signal. This paper presents the variance expression of the normalized frequency estimator taking into consideration the conjugate component in the signal spectrum. The simulation results confirm the accuracy of the expression for different orders of the time windows used as a function of measurement time and SNR value. The results of the simulation show that the efficiency of the entire system can be increased using the method, which can be also applied in many other fields of science and technology. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) has been adopted in various high-speed wireless communication systems. OFDM systems using direct-conversion transceivers are gaining much interest because of low cost and power. However, such systems can suffer from carrier frequency offset (CFO) and transmitter (TX)/receiver (RX) in-phase/quadrature-phase (I/Q) imbalances. These impairments may have a tremendous impact on the performance and cannot be efficiently eliminated in the analog domain. In this paper, we propose an efficient joint estimator for CFO and TX/RX I/Q imbalances in the digital baseband domain. The proposed method designs a training sequence at the transmitter that isolates the estimation of TX I/Q imbalance from the other parameters. At the receiver, we form a sinusoidal sequence from the received signal, which is used to jointly estimate the CFO and RX I/Q imbalance iteratively through the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). Then we estimate the TX I/Q imbalance using the ratio of the estimated sequences just before CFO and RX I/Q imbalance with previously estimated parameters. Simulation results confirm the advantages of the proposed method over existing algorithms in terms of efficiency and estimation accuracy. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Output by a photovoltaic array is nonlinear and changes with solar irradiation and cell temperature. Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) is needed to maximize the energy produced. Most MPPT techniques include the time derivative of current and voltage. These electrical signals are disturbed by highfrequency noise such as from the power device switching. Lowpass filters are used to reduce circuit noise, but estimation error occurs when the maximumpower point is calculated. We therefore apply an adaptive observer to estimate the time derivative of noisy signals. Specifically, we propose an auto-tuning velocity estimator with a forgetting factor based on the adaptive observer. We also improve the incremental conductance method by using an auto-tuning velocity estimator. © 2015, Fuji Technology Press. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Recent research results in the field of algorithms for Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) have pointed out that the estimators based on dynamic phasor models are generally preferable to track waveform parameters over time. This statement is definitely true when amplitude, phase, frequency and rate of change of frequency (ROCOF) fluctuate significantly within the observation interval used to estimate them. Unfortunately, these estimation algorithms can be very sensitive to narrow-band disturbances, unless these contributions are explicitly included in the model at the expense of a larger computational complexity. However, if the observation intervals are so short that the waveform parameter variations each of them are minor, then algorithms based on static phasor model can provide accurate results with a reasonably low computational burden. Since the waveform fundamental frequency is a key parameter for power systems monitoring and control, in this paper the estimation accuracy of three classes of state-of-the-art algorithms based on a static signal model is analyzed and compared when only few waveform cycles affected by both steady-state disturbances (e.g. harmonics) and amplitude or phase oscillations are collected. © 2016 IEEE.},

The proposed algorithm performance is compared with the commonly used full-cycle discrete Fourier transform (DFT), the improved discrete Fourier transform, and the wavelet transform based methods. It is shown that improved recursive wavelet transform possesses an improvement over a wide range of decaying DC components, harmonic distortions, frequency deviations, and sampling frequency.

We develop the pilot power distribution and positioning approach for the training sequence design under the channel mean-square-error (MSE) minimization criterion considering the existence of IQI and guard bands. For the pilot power allocation, we formulate the problem into semi-definite programming whereas positions are assigned with either a heuristic greedy method or fairness instigating genetic combinatorial optimization.

The APS will monitor system modifications done from the estimation of the fundamental frequency. For this, three methods of fundamental frequency estimation such as: (a) zero-crossing, (b) adjustment of points to a pure sinusoidal waveform method (APPSW), and (c) algorithm based on discrete Fourier transform (DFT). Here, these algorithms were applied in distribution systems with distributed generation (DG), and were compared and analyzed the behavior of the APS. The proposed adaptive protection method by frequency estimation was applied in a real Brazilian sub-transmission system, owned by Eletrobrs Distributer of Alagoas (EDAL). APS was built using ATP/MODELS. The evaluation methodology for the frequency estimators is based in statistical error such as mean square error. The DFT based estimator presented better results in comparison with the other evaluated algorithms. Therefore, the application of the DFT method to the adaptive overcurrent protection presented good results of the relays settings and on the protection of the system.},

	abstract = {Reservoir computing (RC) is attracting widespread attention in several signal processing domains owing to its nonlinear stateful computation. It deals particularly well with time-series prediction tasks and reduces training complexity over recurrent neural networks. It is also suitable for hardware implementation whereby device physics are utilized in performing data processing. In this paper, the RC concept is applied to modeling a Multiple-Input Multiple-Output Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) system. Due to the harsh propagation environment, the transmitted signal undergoes severe distortion that must be compensated for at the receiver. The nonlinear distortion introduced by the power amplifier at the transmitter further complicates this process. An effective channel estimation scheme is therefore required. In this paper, we introduce a MIMO-OFDM channel estimation scheme utilizing Echo State Network (ESN). Echo State Networks are powerful recurrent neural networks that can predict time-series very well. They acts as a black-box for system modeling purposes and models nonlinear dynamic systems efficiently. Simulation results for the bit error rate of the nonlinear MIMO-OFDM system show that the introduced channel estimator outperforms commonly used channel estimation schemes. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In this paper, an integrator based method to estimate the effective wind speed in wind turbine systems is proposed. First, the aerodynamic torque was accurately estimated through a proportional gain based observer where the generator speed is the measured output of the system. The torque signal contains not only useful frequencies of the wind, but also high frequencies and the ones due to structural vibration. The useful information of the wind signal is low frequency. A spectral analysis permitted the determination of the useful frequencies. The high frequencies were then filtered before introducing the torque signal in the wind speed observer. The desired effective wind speed was extracted through an integrator based observer using the previously estimated aerodynamic torque. The strength of the method is to avoid numerical solutions used in literature of the wind speed estimation. The effectiveness of the proposed wind speed estimator and its use to control the generator speed has been tested under turbulent situations using the FAST software (Fatigue, Aerodynamics, Structures, and Turbulence), for large scale Megawatt turbine. © 2015 Techno-Press, Ltd.},

	abstract = {One of the most accurate phasor estimation procedures recently proposed in the literature is the so-called Taylor weighted least squares (TWLS) algorithm, which relies on a dynamic phasor model of an electrical waveform at nominal frequency. In this paper, an extension of the TWLS algorithm [called generalized TWLS (GTWLS) algorithm] to a generic (not only nominal) reference frequency is described and the accuracies of the returned estimates are analyzed through meaningful simulations, performed in different steady-state and dynamic testing conditions according to the IEEE Standard C37.118.1-2011 about synchrophasor measurement for power systems and its Amendment IEEE Standard C37.118.1a-2014. It is shown that the accuracy of the total vector error (TVE), frequency error (FE), and rate of change of frequency error (RFE) normally decreases as the deviation between the reference frequency and the true waveform frequency decreases. Furthermore, a two-step procedure for accurate estimation of the phasor parameters is proposed. In the first step, the waveform frequency is estimated by a classical interpolated discrete Fourier transform (IpDFT) algorithm. The second step then returns an estimate of the phasor parameters by applying the TWLS algorithm based on the frequency estimate returned by the first step. It is shown that the proposed procedure, called the GTWLS-IpDFT algorithm, can comply with the P-class or the M-class of performances in all the considered testing conditions when an appropriate number of waveform cycles is considered and the most significant disturbances are removed from the analyzed waveform. Finally, uncertainties of the proposed estimators and the IpD2 FT algorithm recently presented in the literature are also compared. © 2015 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the expressions for the phasor parameter estimates returned by the Taylor-based weighted least-squares (TWLS) approach, achieved using either complex-valued or real-valued variables, are derived. In particular, the TWLS phasor estimator and its derivatives are expressed as weighted sums of the discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT) of the analyzed waveform and its derivatives. The derived expressions show that the TWLS algorithm is sensitive to lower order harmonics and interharmonics located close to the waveform frequency when few waveform cycles are analyzed. Also, the algorithm sensitivity to wideband noise is explained. The relationship between the TWLS phasor estimator and the waveform DTFT is then specifically analyzed when either a static or a second-order dynamic phasor model is assumed. Moreover, a simple and accurate procedure for evaluating the TWLS estimator of the dynamic phasor parameters is proposed. The derived expressions for the real-valued version are then approximated in order to reduce the required computational burden so as to achieve the simplified TWLS (STWLS) procedure. That procedure can be advantageously employed in real-time low-cost applications when the reference frequency used in the TWLS approach is estimated in runtime to improve estimation accuracy. Finally, computer simulations show that the phasor parameter estimates returned by the STWLS procedure when the waveform frequency is estimated by the interpolated discrete Fourier transform method comply with the M-class of performance if an appropriate number of waveform cycles is considered. © 2015 IEEE.},

The proposed method can produce fast speed estimation, easy to implement, free from integrator and is robust to variations in the parameter error giving improved performance for speed sensor less control of induction motor drive over wide speed range including low speeds. Also, indirect field oriented control involve feed forward adjustment of the slip frequency which is dependent upon varying rotor time constant and may distort the field orientation if not compensated.

	abstract = {This paper proposes a solution for the transient grid frequency drift that occurs when active power transients take place in weak grids. Microgrids (MGs) are by definition weak grids, exhibiting a low inertia and high impedance which make them prone to contingencies that compromise the grid quality and stability. Particularly, the low inertia of the generators coupled to a MG could make the rotor speed to be affected by load changes, thus affecting the grid frequency. When compared with previous works, this research proposes a method for the estimation of the steady state reference frequency and the use of a Luenberger type observer for the estimation of the load current, leading to an improvement in the dynamics and the mitigation of the compensator phase lag due to the grid frequency estimator. Different control strategies are compared during the analytical discussion and validated through experimental results. © 2015 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In this paper, an Instantaneous Power Signal (IPS) has been used to extract amount of active/reactive power in real-time. Estimation of real-time power is challenging in single-phase systems due to the presence of double-frequency ripple in IPS. In conventional methods the low bandwidth filters are used to remove this ripple. In this paper the real-time power estimation is obtained first by presenting the problem in terms time dependent linear optimization and then solved by using a least square (LS) method. In order to tackle the drawbacks associated with the conventional methods based on dq rotating frames and grid synchronization algorithms, the proposed algorithm is modified to be recursive and windows type to reduce the computational time. It is mathematically shown that by adding one additional parameter the active and reactive power estimation can be made independent of the initial time value. Simulation and experimental results prove the superior performance of the proposed estimator in comparison with the conventional estimators and the other least square algorithms, such as Kalman filters and forgetting factor, in term of convergence time and the amount of undershoot/overshoot in estimation of active and reactive power from instantaneous power signal. © 2016 IEEE.},

In this work, both the series impedance and the shunt admittance of the transmission system are considered. The PMSM current controller is restructured to be an inverter current controller. A static estimator is implemented to estimate the PMSM stator voltage and current.

Since this power ratio depends on the frequency band, the aperiodicity should be given for several frequency bands. The proposed D4C (Definitive Decomposition Derived Dirt-Cheap) estimator is based on an extension of a temporally static group delay representation of periodic signals. In this paper, the principle and algorithm of D4C are explained, and its effectiveness is discussed with reference to objective and subjective evaluations.

	abstract = {Quantitative ultrasound (QUS) techniques using radiofrequency (RF) backscattered signals have been used for tissue characterization of numerous organ systems. One approach is to use the magnitude and frequency dependence of backscatter echoes to quantify tissue structures. Another approach is to use first-order statistical properties of the echo envelope as a signature of the tissue microstructure. We propose a unification of these QUS concepts. For this purpose, a mixture of homodyned K-distributions is introduced to model the echo envelope, together with an estimation method and a physical interpretation of its parameters based on the echo signal spectrum. In particular, the total, coherent and diffuse signal powers related to the proposed mixture model are expressed explicitly in terms of the structure factor previously studied to describe the backscatter coefficient (BSC). Then, this approach is illustrated in the context of red blood cell (RBC) aggregation. It is experimentally shown that the total, coherent and diffuse signal powers are determined by a structural parameter of the spectral Structure Factor Size and Attenuation Estimator. A two-way repeated measures ANOVA test showed that attenuation ( -value of 0.077) and attenuation compensation ( -value of 0.527) had no significant effect on the diffuse to total power ratio. These results constitute a further step in understanding the physical meaning of first-order statistics of ultrasound images and their relations to QUS techniques. The proposed unifying concepts should be applicable to other biological tissues than blood considering that the structure factor can theoretically model any spatial distribution of scatterers. © 2015 IEEE.},

In this study, a novel hybrid method of minimum frequency and maximum entropy (MFME) is proposed for accurately and rapidly estimating the probability density function (PDF) of renewable power production. Based on the maximum entropy (ME) principle, a probability distribution optimization model is built to obtain a PDF estimator with the maximum distribution entropy. For convenience in solving the model, the probability density estimates of actual samples calculated by the minimum frequency (MF) method are introduced as a supplement to the moment constraints of the ME optimization model. The results indicate that the MFME has a higher accuracy compared with the conventional parameter distribution estimation(CPDE) and Gaussian kernel density estimation (GKDE), and its advantages of no boundary effects and a fast sampling speed for a large original sample size are more suitable for the PDF estimation of renewable power production. © 2016 IEEE.},

In power systems, the undesired components are the decaying dc offset and harmonics. These components could cause delay in algorithm convergence time and deviation from the desired results to a great extent. This paper proposes a new recursive algorithm for accurate and fast estimation of the instantaneous electrical variables such as frequency, amplitude and phase angle. The new algorithm provides an improvement over the existing recursive wavelet transform and, therefore, it is called IRWT. The IRWT performance is compared with the commonly used full-cycle discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and the recursive wavelet transform (RWT) methods. Since it uses a special mother wavelet function, it reduces computational complexity compared to the conventional DFT based method. Compared to the recursive wavelet transform (RWT) method, it has a faster response time. It is shown that IRWT possesses an improvement over a wide range of decaying dc component, harmonic distortions, frequency deviation and sampling frequency compared to the previously proposed methods. This characteristic of IRWT makes it a good candidate for the real-time applications in any power systems. © 2016 IEEE.},

For harmonic signals, we demonstrate that the MLE can be approximated by a cumulated periodogram of the zero, positive and negative sequence components.

The method enables the estimation of the number of active users in a given frequency band, the power received from each user, the occupied time slots and the front-end noise floor. The proposed approach takes advantage of the statistical properties of the averaging estimator output, which allows to model the received estimated power as a Gaussian mixture. This model represents the distributions of the users transmitted signal power as well as the system noise floor. Moreover, the Gaussian with the lowest mean that is related with the noise floor, can be used to estimate an adaptive threshold for a constant false alarm rate detector. Finally, the method was validated in a Wi-Fi experimental setup, where real-world data was acquired with a software defined radio. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

The proposed method aims to achieve balanced output voltages as well as a near unity input power factor operation. First, an opportune reference current accurately generated, and a proportional integral resonant controller are designed in a dq reference frame that is synchronized with the positive sequence of the grid voltages so as to achieve a perfect tracking of input reactive power reference. Then, a real-time estimator of the virtual dc-link voltage is developed with the aim to provide balanced output voltages; therefore, an almost constant active power free of low frequency ripple is supplied from the grid.

Also, this controller does not need a voltage regulator or a current regulator and is easy for the implementation and parameter tuning through the design of the desired tracking error dynamics and the UDE filters. Experimental results are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed method for different disturbance rejection scenarios, the low-voltage fault-ride through capability, and the weak grid operation capability.

	abstract = {Monitoring the levels of sedation-analgesia may be helpful for managing patient stress on minimally invasive medical procedures. Monitors based on EEG analysis and designed to assess general anesthesia cannot distinguish reliably between a light and deep sedation. In this work, the Poincaré plot is used as a nonlinear technique applied to EEG signals in order to characterize the levels of sedation-analgesia, according to observed categorical responses that were evaluated by means of Ramsay Sedation Scale (RSS). To study the effect of high frequencies due to EMG activity, three different frequency ranges (FR1=0.5-110 Hz, FR2=0.5-30 Hz and FR3=30-110 Hz) were considered. Indexes from power spectral analysis and plasma concentration of propofol and remifentanil were also compared with the bispectral index BIS. An adaptive Neurofuzzy Inference System was applied to model the interaction of the best indexes with respect to RSS score for each analysis, and leave-one-out cross validation method was used. The ability of the indexes to describe the level of sedation-analgesia, according with the RSS score, was evaluated using the prediction probability (Pk). The results showed that the ratio SD1/SD2FR3 contains useful information about the sedation level, and SD1FR2 and SD2FR2 had the best performance classifying response to noxious stimuli. Models including parameters from Poincaré plot emerge as a good estimator of sedation-analgesia levels. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Three common stochastic tools, the climacogram i.e. variance of the time averaged process over averaging time scale, the autocovariance function and the power spectrum are compared to each other to assess each one’s advantages and disadvantages in stochastic modelling and statistical inference. Although in theory, all three are equivalent to each other (transformations one another expressing second order stochastic properties), in practical application their ability to characterize a geophysical process and their utility as statistical estimators may vary. In the analysis both Markovian and non Markovian stochastic processes, which have exponential and power-type autocovariances, respectively, are used. It is shown that, due to high bias in autocovariance estimation, as well as effects of process discretization and finite sample size, the power spectrum is also prone to bias and discretization errors as well as high uncertainty, which may misrepresent the process behaviour (e.g. Hurst phenomenon) if not taken into account. Moreover, it is shown that the classical climacogram estimator has small error as well as an expected value always positive, well-behaved and close to its mode (most probable value), all of which are important advantages in stochastic model building. In contrast, the power spectrum and the autocovariance do not have some of these properties. Therefore, when building a stochastic model, it seems beneficial to start from the climacogram, rather than the power spectrum or the autocovariance. The results are illustrated by a real world application based on the analysis of a long time series of high-frequency turbulent flow measurements. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {Selected mapping (SLM) is a well-known method for reducing peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. However, as a consequence of implementing SLM, OFDM receivers often require estimation of some side information (SI) in order to achieve successful data recovery. Existing SI estimation schemes have very high computational complexities that put additional constraints on limited resources and increase system complexity. To address this problem, an alternative SLM approach that facilitates estimation of SI in the form of phase detection is presented. Simulations show that this modified SLM approach produces similar PAPR reduction performance when compared to conventional SLM. With no amplifier distortion and in the presence of non-linear power amplifier distortion, the proposed SI estimation approach achieves similar data recovery performance as both standard SLM–OFDM (with perfect SI estimation) and also when SI estimation is implemented through the use of an existing frequency-domain correlation (FDC) decision metric. In addition, the proposed method significantly reduces computational complexity compared with the FDC scheme and an ML estimation scheme. © 2016 Elsevier GmbH},

This proposal takes advantage of CS properties to reduce the complexity of the algorithm by performing all the operations in the frequency domain, and without the necessity of noise/variance estimators. The proposal is compared to some wellknown methods like zero forcing and minimum mean-square error (MMSE) through the transmission of data under different PLC channels. Bit error rate (BER) is also measured using Middleton Class A impulse noise (IN) model and the performance of all methods is finally evaluated under a time-variant PLC channel model showing the importance of dynamic equalisation on PLC systems. Reported computational resources and simulations show that the proposal is four time faster than MMSE and improves the BER performance by up to 4 dB. In addition, the proposed identification algorithms shows to work properly even in PLC channels with attenuations higher than 40 dB and severe IN scenarios. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2016.},

	abstract = {Broadband Power Line Communications (PLC) have taken advantage of the research advances in multi-carrier modulations to mitigate frequency selective fading, and their adoption opens up a myriad of applications in the field of sensory and automation systems, multimedia connectivity or smart spaces. Nonetheless, the use of these multi-carrier modulations, such as Wavelet-OFDM, requires a highly accurate symbol timing estimation for reliably recovering of transmitted data. Furthermore, the PLC channel presents some particularities that prevent the direct use of previous synchronization algorithms proposed in wireless communication systems. Therefore more research effort should be involved in the design and implementation of novel and robust synchronization algorithms for PLC, thus enabling real-time synchronization. This paper proposes a symbol timing estimator for broadband PLC based on cross-correlation with multilevel complementary sequences or Zadoff-Chu sequences and its efficient implementation in a FPGA; the obtained results show a 90% of success rate in symbol timing estimation for a certain PLC channel model and a reduced resource consumption for its implementation in a Xilinx Kyntex FPGA. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

The second part, represents an estimator of the fundamental frequency, which is proposed to be a saturated integrator in order to keep the fundamental frequency inside a given interval in a soft manner. The paper also presents a sketch of the convergence and stability proof of the proposed scheme.

	abstract = {Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) gyroscope is a new type of inertial sensor with small size, light weight, low cost, and low power consumption. Thus, it has been widely used for guidance and stabilization of many platforms. Although these MEMS devices have such crucial advantages, the stochastic errors, mainly including random walk, bias instability, and quantization noise, may suddenly degrade the system performance in a short period of time. Therefore, a suitable modeling of these errors is vital to guarantee the system performance. In the previous work, Allan variance (AV) (time domain analysis) and power spectral density (frequency domain analysis) techniques are used to identify the random process and get the precise parameter estimation. However, they mainly deal with univariate situations and only give a suitable modeling of uniaxial gyro signal and not a precise estimation for an array of gyros. Aiming at an application in practical engineering and dealing with triaxial rate gyros' stochastic errors, a new algorithm for estimating the statistical parameters of the triaxial rate gyros is proposed. The algorithm in this paper first extends the definition of AV from univariate to multivariable and gives the corresponding statistical properties, i.e., the theoretical mean, variance of the new AV, and covariance between different AV points, and then gives the algorithm based on the best linear unbiased estimator from statistical estimation theory. The performance of the algorithm is demonstrated using both simulated data and experimental data. © 2015 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Considering that the conventional channel interpolation method with sparse and irregular spaced pilots will lead to an error floor in underwater acoustic (UWA) orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) uplink communications, a method for sparse channel estimation and pilot optimization is proposed in this paper. A compressed sensing (CS) algorithm is utilized for sparse channel impulse response estimation, which performs well in sparse and irregular spaced pilots and significantly decreases the channel estimation error. Besides, the pilots' pattern and power joint optimization algorithm based on the random search technique is proposed for the minimum mutual coherence criterion in CS theory, which further improves the performance of CS estimation algorithm. During each iteration step, we randomly pick a pilots' pattern from the subcarrier index set and a pilots' power subset from the available power set. Then we perform this step iteratively within a certain searching time. Finally, the local optimal solution of the objective function for minimizing mutual coherence is considered as the feasible pilots' pattern and power. Simulation results show that the convergence performance of the pilots' pattern and power joint optimization algorithm is much better than that of the pilots' pattern optimization algorithm. Furthermore, the channel estimation error of the proposed method is much lower than that of conventional least-squares channel estimator based on linear interpolation, CS channel estimator without pilot optimization, and CS channel estimator merely with pilots' pattern optimization in channels of different multipath delay spreads. Finally, performance of the proposed method is demonstrated in the UWA uplink OFDMA systems with interleaved and generalized carrier assignment schemes respectively in the two-user case in a pool experiment. Experimental results show that the proposed method decreases dramatically the bit error rate in both carrier assignment schemes, and simultaneous reception for two users is achieved when signal noise ratio is larger than 10 dB. ©, 2015, Chinese Physical Society.

This paper describes a novel, simple, and effective method to thwart TDS attacks on SL. The proposed method works by augmenting the controller with a time-delay estimator to estimate any time delays. The modified controller controls the system under TDS attack. Also, the time-delay estimator will track time delays introduced by an adversary using a modified model reference control with an indirect supervisor and a modified least mean square minimization technique. © 2010-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Cognitive radio finds the solution of bandwidth constraints on the communication system and dynamically captures the unoccupied spectrum by a technique of spectrum sensing. Periodogram based spectrum sensing may be a valid technique where the power spectral density of the received signal can be estimated from the observed samples. However, the estimate may suffer from inconsistency problem if the sample size is large. To overcome this difficulty, the concept of cepstrum estimator has been coined in different literature where the estimator can be calculated from the logarithm of the estimated power spectral density. Also the inconsistency problem can be avoided by this method. In this article, the utility of cepstrum has been particularized in order to find vacant frequency bands. The performance of the detection technique has been justified with false alarm and detection probabilities. Simulation results are provided in support of our proposition. © 2015 IEEE.},

The most general point-to-point periodic channel model includes periodic variations of the channel transfer function and of the noise statistics. In this work we study carrier frequency offset estimation for linear channels with periodic characteristics. We design a maximum likelihood estimator (MLE), analytically characterize its asymptotic performance, and provide guidelines for its low-complexity implementation. We compare the strengths and weaknesses of the new estimator to those of an ad-hoc extended estimator obtained by adapting an MLE, originally designed for time-invariant channels, to periodically time-varying channels via a time partitioning approach. We numerically evaluate the performance of the new estimator and of the ad-hoc estimator, and illustrate the gain of rigorously accounting for the periodic characteristics of the channel, as opposed to the currently prevailing ad-hoc approach. © 2016 IEEE.},

Independency on order and amplitude of harmonics, fast dynamic and high accuracy is the bold features of designed estimators. As in the case of load increase/decrease, sag/swell and phase jump in voltage, the optimal compensation is done in less than half a cycle with low THD value. In addition to compensate an infected power network by oscillation frequency, second order general integrator-frequency locked loop (SOGI-FLL) control loop based on wavelet transform (WT) and fuzzy logic controller (FLC) has been proposed.

One pressing computational hurdle in high frequency financial statistics is the tremendous amount of data and the optimization procedures that require computing power beyond the currently available desktop systems. In this article, we focus on the statistical inference problem on large volatility matrix using high-frequency financial data, and propose a regularization approach to achieve lower prediction errors. We also applied a hybrid parallelization solution to carry out efficient computations for high dimensional statistical methods via intra-day high-frequency data. A variety of hardware and software based HPC techniques, including parallel R, Intel Math Kernel Library, and automatic offloading to Intel Xeon Phi coprocessor are applied to speed up the statistical computations. Our numerical studies are based on high-frequency price data on stocks traded in New York Stock Exchange in 2013. The analysis results show that the constructed estimator using regularization approach generally achieves higher prediction power while enjoying faster convergence rate. We demonstrate significant performance improvement on statistical inference for high-frequency financial data by combining both software and hardware parallelism. © 2015 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Promptitude and accuracy of signals' non-data-aided (NDA) identification is one of the key technology demands in noncooperative wireless communication network, especially in information monitoring and other electronic warfare. Based on this background, this paper proposes a new signal classifier for phase shift keying (PSK) signals. The periodicity of signal's phase is utilized as the assorted character, with which a fractional function is constituted for phase clustering. Classification and the modulation order of intercepted signals can be achieved through its Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the phase clustering function. Frequency offset is also considered for practical conditions. The accuracy of frequency offset estimation has a direct impact on its correction. Thus, a feasible solution is supplied. In this paper, an advanced estimator is proposed for estimating the frequency offset and balancing estimation accuracy and range under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. The influence on estimation range brought by the maximum correlation interval is removed through the differential operation of the autocorrelation of the normalized baseband signal raised to the power of Q. Then, a weighted summation is adopted for an effective frequency estimation. Details of equations and relevant simulations are subsequently presented. The estimator proposed can reach an estimation accuracy of 1 0 - 4 even when the SNR is as low as - 15 d B. Analytical formulas are expressed, and the corresponding simulations illustrate that the classifier proposed is more efficient than its counterparts even at low SNRs. © 2016 Qi An et al.},

	abstract = {The use of chirp signals in modern radar and ranging systems have numerous benefits. They are extensively used to improve signal-to-noise ratio and range resolution. The performance capabilities of these signals are directly related to their time-bandwidth product, i.e., the duration and bandwidth of the pulse. Ultra-wideband chirp signals are further desirable because they span a large bandwidth, making them resistant to narrowband environmental interference. The accurate detection and measurement of high chirp signals is difficult due to the necessity of a high-sampling analog-digital converter, a target measurement platform with high computational power, and a time-of-arrival (TOA) estimator with high temporal resolution. The difficulty of the problem is further compounded with the requirement that no a priori knowledge of the signal, noise, or operating environment is known. This paper presents a practical approach and implementation of a high linear chirp rate receiver and TOA estimator pair capable of detecting and measuring stationary radio frequency pulses as well as linear chirp rates up to 1.18 GHz in 400 ns. The high-resolution TOA algorithm and linear chirp receiver have been prototyped, synthesized, and placed and routed for a Virtex 6 SX475 FPGA. © 2016 IEEE.},

As opposed to conventional static state estimators, where the inclusion of these electric components has been neglected so far, the proposed approach permits the determination of the steady state operation of a power system in the event of a supply-demand unbalance by estimating the magnitude of the frequency deviation from its nominal value. The state estimation is based on measurements related to those that should be obtained by a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system and phasor measurement units. For the purpose of this paper, the set of values associated with SCADA measurements (nodal power injections, power flows, and voltage magnitudes) and phasor measurement unit (PMU) measurements (voltage and current phasors) are generated from a power flow analysis of the network under study. Lastly, numerical simulations are reported to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {This paper presents modeling and analysis of two variations of the multitaper detector namely multiple antenna detection of a single-user multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) node, and the multitaper method (MTM) combined with singular value decomposition (SVD), which is known as the MTM-SVD processor. Motivated by the reputation of the MTM as the best nonparametric power spectral density (PSD) estimator and after reviewing the limited previous research attempts, which focus on single-input-single-output (SISO) multitapering, we present the exact analytical models for the two considered derivatives of the multitaper method over fading channels by making use of the theory of Hermitian forms and Phase-Type distributions. In addition, using the Neyman-Pearson Approach (NPA), the performance of both detectors is optimized over Nakagami fading. For both multitaper variations, we accurately derive the eigenvalues of the Hermitian form of each detector, where the eigenvalues identify the Phase-Type distribution parameters. This yields generalized expressions for the probabilities of false alarm and missed detection when arbitrary multitaper weights are used. Finally, we investigate the impact of noise uncertainty on the performance of MIMO-MTM. The results show that performance of both detectors is dependent on the total number of discrete prolate spheriodal sequences (DPSSs), while for the MTM-SVD processor the performance is also dependent on the number of cooperating users and the employed frequency resolution. It is also shown that MIMO-MTM is robust under noise uncertainty. The obtained analytical models are proven to be accurate and enables further investigations on the multitaper detector. © 2015 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Cognitive Radios (CR) are regarded as a viable solution to enabling flexible use of the frequency spectrum in future generations of wireless networks. An important aspect of spectrum management in CR systems is adaptation of the spectrum sensing methods employed by CRs in order to accurately detect the changing patterns of spectrum use and to update the spectrum and interference constraints under which CR terminals operate. The cognitive radio paradigm is based on the ability to detect the presence of primary users in a given frequency band. In this scenario a spectrum monitor may estimate the signal power levels of all frequency channels in the band of interest, together with the background noise level. We address Maximum Likelihood estimation for this problem, exploiting a priori knowledge about the primary network, summarized in the spectral shape of primary transmissions. An iterative asymptotic ML estimate is proposed, which can be further simplified in order obtain a computationally more an efficient Least Squares estimator with performance very close to the Cramer-Rao lower bound in several cases of interest. © 2015 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The bandwidth shortage has motivated the exploration of the millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency spectrum for future communication networks. To compensate for the severe propagation attenuation in the mmWave band, massive antenna arrays can be adopted at both the transmitter and receiver to provide large array gains via directional beamforming. To achieve such array gains, channel estimation (CE) with high resolution and low latency is of great importance for mmWave communications. However, classic super-resolution subspace CE methods such as multiple signal classification (MUSIC) and estimation of signal parameters via rotation invariant technique (ESPRIT) cannot be applied here due to RF chain constraints. In this paper, an enhanced CE algorithm is developed for the off-grid problem when quantizing the angles of mmWave channel in the spatial domain where off-grid problem refers to the scenario that angles do not lie on the quantization grids with high probability, and it results in power leakage and severe reduction of the CE performance. A new model is first proposed to formulate the off-grid problem. The new model divides the continuously-distributed angle into a quantized discrete grid part, referred to as the integral grid angle, and an offset part, termed fractional off-grid angle. Accordingly, an iterative off-grid turbo CE (IOTCE) algorithm is proposed to renew and upgrade the CE between the integral grid part and the fractional off-grid part under the Turbo principle. By fully exploiting the sparse structure of mmWave channels, the integral grid part is estimated by a soft-decoding based compressed sensing (CS) method called improved turbo compressed channel sensing (ITCCS). It iteratively updates the soft information between the linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimator and the sparsity combiner. Monte Carlo simulations are presented to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, and the results show that it enhances the angle detection resolution greatly. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Energy saving and resource utility are the key issues for the densified OFDM system. However, most of previous studies do not taking account of the effect of resource utility in the SINR model, e.g. the load factor. In this paper, we firstly formulate the SINR using more realistic model considering load factor in OFDM systems. Based on this model the energy saving problem is formulated as a joint optimization of beamforming and power subject to users' QoS and load constraint of each cell. To sovle this problem, we propose a two-stage scheme to decouple this problem into the beamforming and power control. In the beamforming stage, we resort to a suboptimal beamformer using the idea of best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE); For the power control stage, we try to minimize the transmit sum-power while fulfilling the user's QoS and load constraints based on theory of standard interference mapping. The convergence behavior of the proposed scheme is rigorously proved. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme converges faster in multiple-antenna cases comparing with the single-antenna counterpart. Moreover the proposed beamformer owns advantage against the traditional ones in term of power saving. © 2016 IEEE.},

The power delivering dynamics is introduced at first after considering both frequency dynamics and voltage dynamics. Then the UDE algorithm is adopted to regulate both output voltage amplitude and frequency for accurate real power and reactive power control. With the adoption of the UDE method, the model uncertainty (e.g., power angle) and external disturbance (e.g., variations of grid frequency and grid voltage) can be compensated automatically. Moreover, this UDE-based dynamic power flow control can achieve self-synchronization without an extra synchronization unit (e.g., a phase-locked-loop) when the inverter is connected to the grid. In addition, the proposed controller is easy for implementation and parameter tuning through the designs of desired tracking error dynamics and UDE filters, while having the flexibility and performance of advanced control methodologies. The asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system is analyzed. Experimental results are provided for validation. © 2016 American Automatic Control Council (AACC).},

By ignoring the presence of null carriers in the P1 symbol, the SML method can be simplified with a lower complexity.

	abstract = {The foundation of implementing the Smart Grid concept and related smart applications is based on data acquisition from the grid itself. A significant part of the required data, for smart applications and daily power system operation, consists in voltage and current measurements in substations. An overview of these applications includes:-Phasor Measurement-Protection-Power Quality Monitoring (PQM) and evaluation-Volt and VAR control (VVC) and optimization (VVO)-Accurate Fault Location (AFL)-Power Flow Analysis with State Estimators (synchronized measurements in distribution) At Hydro-Québec (HQ), the last three are shared between HQ TransÉnergie (TSO) and HQ Distribution (DSO) because they require monitoring points in substations and along distribution feeders. Generally, smart applications require the monitoring of voltage and/or current and for some of them (PMU, PQ, VVC) the measurement accuracy is more important than for others (protection, AFL). The data is acquired in substations using a so-called acquisition chain, which includes:-Transducers (instrument transformers & sensors),-Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs),-Communication,-Data storage systems/hardware and analysis software. At present, in Hydro-Québec's substations, the use of transducers is limited to inductive instrument transformers connected with fiber optic cables and whose accuracy of 0.6% is sufficient for protection purposes but not for other applications requiring better accuracy. Crucial technology advances allowed the development of new transducers, also called sensors, which meet the particular requirements of smart applications, namely: better measurement linearity and frequency response. Besides that, they are much smaller in size and less expensive. Some of them are capable of communicating wirelessly, which facilitates their installation in existing substations. HQ TSO has recently mandated IREQ, Hydro-Québec's Research Institute, to initiate a project for exploring and testing novel sensors of PQ grade which are projected to be installed in high voltage/medium voltage (HV/MV) substations, in order to fulfil most of the tasks demanded by smart applications in substations. During the initial phase of this project, the focus is put on MV sensors and more specifically on the accuracy and reliability of voltage and current measurements with respect to signal magnitude and phase angle. Tests performed on such transducers by the scientific community have shown that their accuracy is susceptible to load, frequency and temperature variations. A common solution for improving accuracy consists of performing a thorough calibration of the sensor, which results in a table of calibration factors that can then be used to correct the measurement values. Another task will be to provide a business case for implementing PQ monitoring in existing substations based on the comparison of two solutions:-Keeping the actual technology in place (existing VTs in HQ substations) and performing locally a full calibration of VTs.-Installing new smart sensors in substations for PQ monitoring. This feasibility project will also try to find answers or solutions to a major problem, namely the tridimensional configuration of calibration factors (load, frequency and temperature) to be used with new sensors. The paper discusses aspects covering measurements performed in substations, measurement chain (IEDs and sensors), accuracy, calibration and communication as envisioned by HQ TSO. © 2016 CIGRE.

	abstract = {The transmissibility based operational modal analysis (TOMA) has drawn great attention due to its insensitivity to the nature of external excitation. Different from conventional modal identification approaches working in the frequency domain, it opens up a new path to find the system poles by utilizing mode shape information. Recently, the power spectral density transmissibility (PSDT) driven peak picking (PP) approach was proposed by authors for large-scale linear engineering structures under a single operational loading condition. As a nonparametric method, however, the PSDT-driven PP approach identifies natural frequencies by just observing signal-based features subjectively without fitting a parametric model. An enhanced PSDT approach is proposed in this study. The system poles are identified by employing the least-squares complex frequency-domain (LSCF) estimator, following which the mode shapes are evaluated by utilizing singular value decomposition (SVD) technique for PSDT matrix. As a result, a stabilization diagram containing the information of frequency, damping ratio and mode shape can be constructed to separate the stable system poles. Furthermore, the asymptotic analysis is implemented to investigate the robustness of PSDT to noise effect. The presented approach is able to maintain the benefits of PSDT and at the same time leads to an improvement of the modal parameter estimation. It is computationally efficient, simple, stable and robust to noise. A numerical example subjected to ground motion and two structures tested in the field are employed to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {A novel noise power spectral density (PSD) estimator for disturbed speech signals which operates in the short-time Fourier domain is presented. A noise PSD estimate is provided by constrained tracing with time of the noisy observation separately for each frequency bin. The constraint is a limitation of the logarithmic magnitude change between successive time frames. Since speech onset is assumed as sudden rises in the noisy observation, a fixed and adaptive tracing parameter β has been derived to track the contained noise while preventing speech leakage to the noise PSD estimate. The experimental evaluation and comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms, SPP and Minimum Statistics, confirms a lower logarithmic noise estimation error and superior speech enhancement rated in a standard noise reduction system. The proposed concept has extremely low computational complexity and memory usage. Thus, it is well suited for applications where processing power and memory is limited. © 2015 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Power spectrum density transmissibility (PSDT) is a type of complex frequency domain function proposed recently. It describes the relation between cross-spectra of system outputs. Since PSDTs with same local-reference degree of freedom (DOF) combination but with different transferring output DOFs cross each other at the system's poles under certain load condition, the functions have been used as the primary data in operational modal analysis (OMA) to extract modal parameters, and such technique is named as PSDT-based OMA (PSDTOMA). Because PSDT is a concept that appears recently, researches on which, especially, in-depth discussions aim at the essence and properties of PSDT are very rare. For appropriate application of PSDTOMA, it is necessary to perform further study on such problem obviously. In this paper, two paths to get PSDT, which, respectively, are referred to as PSDT estimator and PSDT syntheticism, are given firstly; some properties about PSDT are explored based on the PSDT syntheticism, and the relation between PSDT and single reference transmissibility function (STF) is analyzed. Finally, the above conclusions are verified with numerical values and experimental data. © 2016 Yu Zhang et al.},

To accomplish this task, many approaches have been proposed in the literature. Recently, a modified demodulation-based technique (MDT) has been presented, which aims to accurately extract the grid voltage fundamental parameters under harmonically distorted and frequency-varying conditions. In this letter, it is shown that the MDT is actually a phase-locked loop. The MDT small-signal modeling and stability analysis are then conducted, and some modifications to enhance its performance are suggested. The effectiveness of these modifications is finally confirmed using numerical results. © 1986-2012 IEEE.},

Therefore, new estimation methods are proposed that are based on local correlation between the frequency deviation and interchange power variation measured on all area's tie-lines. The presented estimation methods were compared with a classical approach that is based on the ratio of mean changes as well as with conventional least squares parameter estimators.

The methods reported in the current literature are many based on l2-norm minimisation, the estimated modes from these methods are severely affected in the presence of an outlier or bad measurements. Hence, there is a need to develop the method which can provide a good estimate of the modes even in the presence of outliers in the measurements. In order to mitigate the effect of such bad data, this study proposes a robust Prony estimator for estimating the low frequency modes of power systems. The method is based on minimum covariance determinant technique to find the robust covariance followed by improved Prony to estimate the modes. In this study the proposed method is compared with other methods such as improved Prony, etc. on synthetic test signal at different signal-to-noise ratio in the presence of outliers.

To achieve the maximum of generated power the MPPT principle is essential, it is based on the Perturb & Observe (P&O) algorithm. To reduce cost of the structure by avoiding speed sensors, the adopted MPPT strategy is based on sensorless wind speed, air density and turbine parameters, and generates the output used to control the buck. Then a regulation is realised for the grid side in order to control the inverter and a PLL is used to synchronize the frequency of the inverter voltages with that of the grid voltages. At first, we show the complete chain and detail its components. Then we describe the speed estimator used and the chosen method to design a sensorless MPPT.

The proposed control system allows the active and reactive power control in both directions from grid to vehicle and vehicle to grid, while controlling the DC-bus voltage. Due to the lack of freedom degrees required for orthogonal systems, using the D-Q frame is a challenge in single-phase power conditioning systems. In this paper, an all-pass filter has been used to generate the orthogonal signals in the closed-loop control system. This method generates the orthogonal signals without degrading the dynamics of the closed-loop control system and with less noise in comparison to the other common methods such as differentiators. A DC-bus voltage estimator based on adaptive filter has also been used in this paper to remove the double frequency ripple and in turn increase the reliability and speed of the proposed controller. The proposed control scheme is used to implement the smart charging and power management strategies of the residential loads using electric vehicles as a storage system. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the transient and steady-state performance of the proposed controller in different modes of operation. Also the performance of the proposed DC-bus voltage estimator in removing the double frequency ripple as well as the application of the proposed control scheme in implementation of power management strategies in a typical household, has been shown by using simulation results. © 2015 IEEE.},

It is first established that the original Smart discrete Fourier transform (SDFT) technique designed for real-valued single-phase voltage can be extended to deal with complex-valued αβ transformed voltage. By observing that the underlying time series relationship among the consecutive DFT fundamental components employed by SDFT technique does not hold when noise or unexpected higher order harmonics are present, resulting in suboptimal estimation performances, the least squares framework is then built upon the underlying relationship among the consecutive DFT fundamental components to minimise the mean square model error.

	abstract = {In this paper, we present robust feature extractors that incorporate a regularized minimum variance distortionless response (RMVDR) spectrum estimator instead of the discrete Fourier transform-based direct spectrum estimator, used in many front-ends including the conventional MFCC, to estimate the speech power spectrum. Direct spectrum estimators, e.g., single tapered periodogram, have high variance and they perform poorly under noisy and adverse conditions. To reduce this performance drop we propose to increase the robustness of speech recognition systems by extracting features that are more robust based on the regularized MVDR technique. The RMVDR spectrum estimator has low spectral variance and is robust to mismatch conditions. Based on the RMVDR spectrum estimator, robust acoustic front-ends, namely, are regularized MVDR-based cepstral coefficients (RMCC), robust RMVDR cepstral coefficients (RRMCC) and normalized RMVDR cepstral coefficients (NRMCC). In addition to the RMVDR spectrum estimator, RRMCC and NRMCC also utilize auditory domain spectrum enhancement methods, auditory spectrum enhancement (ASE) and medium duration power bias subtraction (MDPBS) techniques, respectively, to improve the robustness of the feature extraction method. Experimental speech recognition results are conducted on the AURORA-4 large vocabulary continuous speech recognition corpus and performances are compared with the Mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC), perceptual linear prediction (PLP), MVDR spectrum estimator-based MFCC, perceptual MVDR (PMVDR), cochlear filterbank cepstral coefficients (CFCC), power normalized cepstral coefficients (PNCC), ETSI advancement front-end (ETSI-AFE), and the robust feature extractor (RFE) of Alam et al. (2012). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed robust feature extractors outperformed the other robust front-ends in terms of percentage word error rate on the AURORA-4 large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) task under clean and multi-condition training conditions. In clean training conditions, on average, the RRMCC and NRMCC provide significant reductions in word error rate over the rest of the front-ends. In multi-condition training, the RMCC, RRMCC, and NRMCC perform slightly better in terms of the average word error rate than the rest of the front-ends used in this work. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technology is the key to evolving telecommunication standards including 3GPP-LTE Advanced and WiMAX. Reliability of any OFDM system increases with improved mean square error performance (MSE) of its channel estimator (CE). Particularly, a least squares (LS) based CE incorporating a time-domain denoising threshold, enables better MSE performance, while avoiding the need for a-priori knowledge of channel statistics (KCS). Existing optimal time-domain thresholds exhibit suboptimal behavior for completely unavailable KCS environments. This is because they involve consistent estimation of one or more KCS parameters, and corresponding estimation errors introduce severe degradation in MSE performance of the CE. To overcome the MSE degradation, this paper proposes a weighted-noise threshold, by introducing a modified hypothesis-testing-problem (HTP) interpretation. Derivation of resulting analytical MSE expression is also provided. Results of OFDM system simulations carried out in rayleigh faded ITU-TU6 and WiMAX-SUI4 channel environments with U-shaped power spectral densities, are presented. The performance results show that, compared to many of the existing thresholds, the proposed threshold renders better MSE performance to the CE and higher reliability to the OFDM system in terms of better bit error rate (BER) performance. © 2015, Indian Academy of Sciences.},

The proposed technique effectively estimates the distortions caused by power delay profile. The performance is measured using the mean squared error between the actual and the estimated frequency response. The performance is compared to the performance of a 2×1 dimensional Wiener interpolator, which consistently yields the lowest mean square error but also the highest complexity.

	abstract = {This study deals with multi-path channel estimation for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems under slow to moderate fading conditions. Advanced algorithms exploit the channel time-domain correlation by using Kalman filters (KFs) based on an approximation of the time-varying channel. Recently, it was shown that under slow to moderate fading, near-optimal channel multi-path complex amplitude estimation can be obtained by using the integrated random walk (RW) model as the channel approximation. To reduce the complexity of the high-dimensional RW-KF for joint estimation of the multi-path complex amplitudes, we propose using a lower dimensional RW-KF that estimates the complex amplitude of each path separately. We demonstrate that this amounts to a simplification of the joint multi-path Kalman gain formulation through the Woodbury's identities. Hence, this new algorithm consists of a superposition of independent single-path single-carrier KFs, which were optimized in our previous studies. This observation allows us to adapt the optimization to the actual multi-path multi-carrier scenario, to provide analytic formulas for the mean-square error performance and the optimal tuning of the proposed estimator directly as a function of the physical parameters of the channel (Doppler frequency, signal-to-noise-ratio, power delay profile). These analytic formulae are given for the first-, second-, and third-order RW models used in the KF. The proposed per-path KF is shown to be as efficient as the exact KF (i.e., the joint multi-path KF), and outperforms the autoregressive-model-based KFs proposed in the literature. © 1991-2012 IEEE.},

This calculation can be performed by the Boundary Element Method (BEM) but the velocity field associated with friction-induced vibrations is composed of several harmonic components. Therefore, the BEM equation has to be solved for each frequencies and in most cases, the number of harmonic component is significant and the computation time can be prohibitive. In this paper, a criterion based on the kinetic energy convergence allows to reduce the number of frequencies by selecting the predominant harmonic components in the dynamic reponse. Then, a new method will be proposed in order to quickly well estimate the noise emission in free space. This approach will be based on an approximated acoustic power of the brake system which is assumed to be a punctual source, an interpolated directivity and the level decrease of the acoustic power. This method is applied on two classical cases of squeal with one and two unstable modes. It allows to well reconstruct the acoustic power levels map. Several error estimators are introduced and show that the reconstructed field is close to the reference calculated with a complete BEM.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new Extended Kalman filter-based method for the estimation of the rotor angular speed of a synchronous machine. The main utility of the estimated speed is in the power system stabilizer. The paper briefly reviews the problems associated with the existing methods for reliable and accurate rotor speed measurement or estimation. It is shown that the existing methods of rotor speed estimation have some severe drawbacks and may cause the power system stabilizer to operate suboptimal or even produce negative damping over a specific frequency range when an inaccurate rotor speed signal is used as the input to the power system stabilizer. Most importantly it demonstrates that a system equipped with it behaves as predicted in simulations, especially when examining inter-area modes. The new rotor speed estimation method was implemented on an industrial control platform and integrated in a modern digital excitation system. A series of hardware-in-the-loop simulations were run to examine the properties of the new speed estimator. The simulations confirm that the new speed offers superior performance in terms of speed estimation accuracy, which allows the proper damping of oscillations over a frequency range of interest. © 2014 IEEE.},

Channel impairments, specifically in wireless communication degrade the performance of accurate SNR measurement and said problem becomes more serious in low SNR regime. As a result it reduces the performance of adaptive transmission in OFDM systems. To alleviate this problem we develop a pilot based Pre FFT (time domain) Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) estimator in the presence of frequency selective Rayleigh fading channel. A novel time domain SNR estimation technique is proposed that accurately measures the Signal-to-Noise Ratio in low SNR regime, where signal plus noise power is evaluated by using autocorrelation of received signal and signal power is indirectly estimated from pilot power using cross correlation. Simulation results show that proposed method has very less bias and very close to the actual SNR values. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

	abstract = {A wideband spectrum sensing scheme for cognitive radios is put forward in this letter. The proposed method operates over the total frequency bands simultaneously rather than a single band each time. It first estimates the number of occupied subbands, and then determines the accurate locations of occupied subbands as well as the vacant ones. Applying the ideas of multistage Wiener filter to Gerschgorin disk estimator, this approach jointly makes the decision. In this way, the detection performance is enhanced because of capturing the signal information and suppressing the additive noise. Meanwhile, this approach avoids estimating the covariance matrix as well as the eigenvalue decomposition, and thus achieves a low computational complexity. Distinct from the conventional algorithms, neither noise power estimation nor prior knowledge of primary user signal is required, making the proposed algorithm robust to noise uncertainty and suitable for blind detection. Simulations under various conditions are presented to demonstrate the benefits of this approach and the results indicate that it surpasses the existing sensing algorithms. © 2014 IEEE.},

We present two model predictive control (MPC) algorithms that exploit a priori knowledge of delay statistics. We also present three Kalman filter-based state estimation methods that handle measurements with heterogeneous delays that are known a posteriori. We simulate the closed loop system to quantify the error while the system tracks simplified power system signals of various frequencies. We find that the MPC algorithm incorporating the full delay distribution, versus only the mean delay, reduces the average tracking error 39%. Also, incorporating individual TCL models, identified on-line, within the state estimator versus only using a TCL aggregation model reduces the average estimation error 19%. © 2015 IEEE.},

Algorithm and architecture level plays an important role in determining final system performances.

The first step is a linear state estimator that utilizes only synchrophasors. The second step is an iterative state estimator that combines conventional measurements with pseudo-measurements obtained from the first step. The developed hybrid model takes advantage of the high sampling frequency of the synchrophasors by running the first step state estimator several times between two consecutive runs of the second step state estimator. The methodology was tested on the IEEE 14 and 57 buses test systems and the real full Croatian transmission power system model. It was also compared with other hybrid models. The proposed formulation of the hybrid state estimator is comparable with other hybrid models in view of accuracy and convergence, and it offers enhanced filtering of measurement errors. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {A novel hybrid channel estimator is proposed for multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency- division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) system with per-subcarrier transmit antenna selection having optimal power allocation among subcarriers. In practice, antenna selection information is transmitted through a binary symmetric control channel with a crossover probability. Linear minimum mean-square error (LMMSE) technique is optimal technique for channel estimation in MIMO-OFDM system. Though LMMSE estimator performs well at low signal to noise ratio (SNR), in the presence of antenna-to-subcarrier- assignment error (ATSA), it introduces irreducible error at high SNR. We have proved that relaxed MMSE (RMMSE) estimator overcomes the performance degradation at high SNR. The proposed hybrid estimator combines the benefits of LMMSE at low SNR and RMMSE estimator at high SNR. The vector mean square error (MSE) expression is modified as scalar expression so that an optimal power allocation can be performed. The convex optimization problem is formulated and solved to allocate optimal power to subcarriers minimizing the MSE, subject to transmit sum power constraint. Further, an analytical expression for SNR threshold at which the hybrid estimator is to be switched from LMMSE to RMMSE is derived. The simulation results show that the proposed hybrid estimator gives robust performance, irrespective of ATSA error.},

	abstract = {Motivated by the growing need for robust and accurate frequency estimators at the low-and medium-voltage distribution levels and the emergence of ubiquitous sensors networks for the smart grid, we introduce a distributed Kalman filtering scheme for frequency estimation. This is achieved by using widely linear state space models, which are capable of estimating the frequency under both balanced and unbalanced operating conditions. The proposed distributed augmented extended Kalman filter (D-ACEKF) exploits multiple measurements without imposing any constraints on the operating conditions at different parts of the network, while also accounting for the correlated and noncircular natures of real-world nodal disturbances. Case studies over a range of power system conditions illustrate the theoretical and practical advantages of the proposed methodology. © 2015 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Wireless communication systems are omnipresent in our everyday life and high standards regarding capacity, reliability, speed and power are naturally expected. In order to satisfy these requirements, more sophisticated and efficient technology is needed. This is especially true for the integrated amplifiers at the transmitter side, which are responsible for the majority of the power consumption. In order to obtain high gain at the low power levels, these amplifiers are operated into their nonlinear region. However, many communication schemes cannot handle the nonlinear distortion generated by such amplifiers. The nonlinear distortions generated at the transmitter side can be compensated through the use of digital predistortion. This method compensates the non-linear effects by first estimating a non-linear model for the amplifier, and then applying the inverse model onto the data during transmission such that the nonlinearities are canceled. The main advantage of this approach is that it allows to use the classical linear communication scheme once the precompensation is performed. In this work, Special attention goes to the estimation of the nonlinear model used for the predistortion. Most nonlinear models are not only nonlinear in behavior but also nonlinear in their parametrization, which requires special care during estimation of the model parameters. Performance of the simple linear least square estimator and nonlinear least square estimator is investigated using a National Instrument student setup. © 2015 The Authors.},

However, a key challenge is to achieve coordinated control of large populations of resources using existing communication and control infrastructure or with minimal addition of new infrastructure. In this paper, we assume that we only have access to realistic measurements, i.e. data from residential smart meters every 15 minutes and noisy real-time measurements of the aggregate power consumption of TCLs from distribution substations. Our contribution is to develop a moving horizon state estimator (MHSE) to estimate the states of individual stochastic TCLs from these measurements. This is in contrast to previous work that focused on estimating the states of aggregate system models. The proposed MHSE is benchmarked against a simpler model-based prediction. We also propose a scalable closed-loop control structure that uses the MHSE method to provide frequency control with TCL populations. We demonstrate our results via a number of case studies with different TCL aggregations, process and measurement noise characteristics, and controller forcing levels. Our simulations show that the MHSE generally provides accurate state estimates and improves the controller performance. © 2014 Power Systems Computation Conference.},

The traditional direct power control method possesses the defect of unfixed switching frequency. A new method three-phase voltage source pulse-width modulation rectifier with high power factor base on direct power control is proposed in this paper. With the analysis of the formation mechanism of the switch table, the stationary coordinate is divided in to 12 vectors to optimize the input voltages. Virtual flux estimator is introduced to replace voltage sensors. Instantaneous power theory is used to calculate the estimated virtual flux active and reactive power with outer voltage and inner power loop control mode. The direct power control strategy of space vector modelation is introduced to provide the fixed switching frequency on pulse-width modulation. The experimental results show that the direct power control system has good dynamic response, so as to achieve active power and reactive power control, which ensures that the input side of the unity power factor control. It is illustrated that this method can achieve higher power factor and total lower harmonic disturbance than the conventional current control strategy. © Fan et al.; Licensee Bentham Open.},

	abstract = {Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes are a class of forward error correction (FEC) linear block codes which provide near-capacity performance for power-efficient communications. Optimum decoding requires accurate combining ratio estimation to scale the input signal in an additive white Gaussian noise channel (AWGN). Test data and analysis show that the performance of the optimal LDPC decoding algorithm is severely degraded when encountering pulsed radio frequency interference (RFI) from sources such as ground based radars. This research effort first reveals that the LDPC performance degradation under pulsed RFI is not due to the burst of errors but to the inaccurate combining ratio estimation. Although an ideal combining ratio estimator (symbol-wise) could mitigate the degradation caused by pulsed RFI, it is not practical for implementation. Some near optimal LDPC decoding algorithms which do not require combining ratio estimation are investigated. One near optimum decoding algorithm 'min-scale' is proposed in the robust decoder design to mitigate pulsed RFI. Analysis shows that 'min-scale' only loses about 0.2 dB performance compared to the optimal decoding algorithm under nominal condition; in a pulsed RFI environment, the designed performance can be achieved if the system design has adequate margin. Without combining ratio estimation, the decoder design complexity is reduced and the risk of performance degradation due to combining ratio estimation error is eliminated. This robust decoder design enables reliable communications to space vehicles which may encounter strong pulsed RFI signals from high power radar systems. © 2015 IEEE.},

The methodology only relies on a single full-system AC power meter and is able to make statistically relevant decisions about the probes reliability.

	abstract = {Grid synchronization is a critical concern for proper control of the energy transferred between the Distributed Power Generation System (DPGS) and the utility grid. Nonlinear estimation techniques are proposed to track the voltage magnitude, phase angle, and frequency of the utility grid. Instead of directly analyzing in abc coordinate frame, the symmetrical component is employed to separate the positive, negative, and zero sequences in the transformed ab stationary coordinate frame. By using ab stationary coordinate frame, the number of system state variables is reduced to five. The results show that our proposed nonlinear estimation technique is efficient in smart power system synchronization. The MATLAB simulation studies have been conducted to compare the performance of Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), Particle Filter (PF), and Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). Computer simulations have shown that the efficacy of our proposed nonlinear estimation methods including the Extended Kalman Filter, Particle Filter, and Unscented Kalman Filter. It also shows that the Unscented Kalman Filter, and the Particle Filters are better estimators, because voltage synchronization problem is nonlinear system, and linearization process which the Extended Kalman Filter is based on is not very accurate. The number of particles in Particle Filter can be increased to improve the accuracy, but there exists a trade off between computational effort and estimation accuracy. In our research, with consideration the same computational complexity, we calculate the Mean Square Error (MSE) to examine the performances of different nonlinear estimation approaches. By comparing the MSE of different estimators, we prove that the Unscented Kalman Filter shows the most accurate performance in voltage synchronization for three phase unbalanced voltage. Our results have shown the potential applications in the future smart power grid synchronization. Copyright © 2015 by ASME.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new self-sensing method for the direct estimation of the slip position angle in the DFIG connected to a dc network. This connection is made by the stator through a diode bridge and by the rotor through a single voltage source inverter. Considerable savings are obtained when this system is used in networks where several systems should work together, because only a dc-link is needed. Additionally to the slip position estimation, required to implement field orientation, it is also necessary to control the stator frequency because the system is connected to a dc link, and consequently the mains do not impose the stator frequency as in the traditional DFIG. The slip angle estimation method is based on the MRAS methodology and compares the stator current amplitude with the q-axis rotor current component computed using the estimation angle. Small estimation errors are obtained using this method. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In this study, the authors present a novel method to improve the performance of automatic repeat request (ARQ) protocol for multiple-input-multiple-output systems that use orthogonal frequency division multiplexing signalling by incorporating partial ARQ (PARQ) mechanism. As a typical ARQ frame has few number of errors, it is useful to retransmit partial sequence of symbols and recover from errors by consuming relatively low bandwidth. The observations from the first transmission and subsequent retransmission are used for joint detection. As a direct consequence of partial retransmission, the bandwidth and power efficiency of the overall system is improved considerably without substantial decrease in the performance. They achieve further bandwidth saving by omitting pilot sequence from the partial retransmission and acquire channel estimate in semi-blind fashion. Partial retransmission of the original information symbol sequence allows the authors to formulate second-order statistics based joint blind channel estimation problem by combining observations from two transmissions. Channel estimation ambiguity inherent to blind methods is resolved by combining cost functions of blind detection and least-square estimator. To evaluate efficacy of the proposed PARQ method, they compare throughput of chase-type hybrid-ARQ and the proposed PARQ methods. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology.},

	abstract = {In the past few years, most of the vehicle manufacturers invest a lot of resources in developing the related electrified subsystems and technologies for improving the electric vehicle performance. The air-condition system is one of the electrified subsystems which provides a comfortable feeling to the passengers. The energy consumption of the air-condition system is only second to the electric propulsion system which could significantly decrease the electric vehicle mileage. Therefore, an energy-saving thermostat controller is developed by Automotive Research and Testing Center to reduce the power consumption. The controller includes a variable-frequency controller for the electric compressor and the fans of the radiators, and a thermal load estimator to calculate the demanded AC power based on several parameters, i.e. the cabin temperature, the environment temperature and the set temperature, and etc. The controller will tune the working conditions of the components to provide the output power as estimated result and avoid unnecessary electric power consumption. In this research, the concept of "felt air temperature" is added into the thermostat controller to help saving additional electric energy. The felt air temperature calculates with a semi-empirical equation based on the cabin temperature, the air velocity from the ventilation outlet and the humidity inside the cabin, and the result is used to tune the working conditions of the active components for saving more energy. Since the felt air temperature could be achieved with a higher air temperature, the thermal load would be lower and the system energy consumption could be decreased. An experiment was executed and the result shown that the COP (coefficient of performance) of the system could be increased by 10% which could improve the efficiency of energy resource.},

The proposed adaptive compensator consists of a least square estimator that estimates the damping and frequency mismatches, and an online compensator that corrects the mismatches. In order to improve the adaptive compensator's convergence rate, we introduce a calibration phase where we identify relations between the unknown parameters (i.e. mismatches, rotation rate and rotation angle). Calibration results show that the unknown parameters lie on a hyperplane. When the gyro is in operation, we project parameters estimated from the least square estimator onto the hyperplane. The projection will reduce the degrees of freedom in parameter estimates, thus guaranteeing persistence of excitation and improving convergence rate. Simulation results show that utilization of the projection method will drastically improve convergence rate of the least square estimator and improve gyro performance. © 2014 by ASME.},

The expressions also apply to periodic pilot-signal bursts inserted into a continuous bit stream. The solutions are optimal in the mean-square-error sense for coherent optical receivers subject to random-walk phase fluctuations and high short-term laser-frequency stability. Low computational time-complexity of only O(n) and space-complexity as low as O(log(n)) are obtained, where n is the size of the estimation block. Better yet, when the pilot-signal is a Continuous Wave tone, the estimator is able to extend its performance up to the maximum correctable frequency-mismatch, which is one-half of the baud rate. We believe that these results contribute to fostering low-power transceiver technology for green communication networks. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Deployment of smart meters has been greatly increased over the recent years. Most of the installed smart meters have been equipped with Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) which enables a bidirectional wireless communication to gather the usage data from gas, electricity and water meters. The insecure wireless channel used by AMI meters jeopardizes the privacy of costumers and brings up cybersecurity issues since it allows hackers to monitor the energy usage data from different houses. To show the penetrability of the system, Received Signal Strength (RSS) - based localization of smart meters incorporating Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimator has been proposed in this paper. By decoding the received signal from a smart meter, one can localize the unoccupied houses or track the people's daily routines. The effectiveness of the proposed ML location estimator has been examined through MATLAB simulation, under the assumption of a log-normal path loss model and Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) modulation and demodulation. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) has been used to find the ML estimation. Finally, the effect of the variance, the number of the sensors and the path loss exponent has been studied on the average Miss Distance Error (MDE). © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

	abstract = {The associated location information is crucial for the data collected by wireless sensor newtworks (WSNs), and nodes have to locate themselves when they are deployed randomly. The radio interferometric positioning system (RIPS) provides high accuracy at low-complexity, which is suitable for cost-limited nodes in WSNs. In the RIPS, two transmitters transmit sinusoids at slightly different frequencies, and the received signal is squared to achieve a low-frequency differential signal at the receivers. The phase difference of the low-frequency differential signals at two receivers is estimated to achieve a range metric called the Qrange, which is a linear combination of distances among four nodes. The squaring operation, however, increases the noise power that degrades the range-estimation performance, and also the Qrange estimator with the traditional RIPS receivers consists of the approximation error. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose the RIPS receiver employing the under sampling techniques (RIPSu) that directly samples the received signal. By avoiding the squaring operation, the RIPS-u can achieve high accuracy and obtain the Q-range estimate without approximation. We provide the MATLAB simulation results to confirm the effectiveness of our proposed RIPS-u. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The joint iterative detection and decoding (JIDD) technique has been proposed by Barbieri et al. (2007) with the objective of compensating the time-varying phase noise and constant frequency offset experienced in satellite communication systems. The application of JIDD to optical coherent receivers in the presence of laser frequency fluctuations has not been reported in prior literature. Laser frequency fluctuations are caused by mechanical vibrations, power supply noise, and other mechanisms. They significantly degrade the performance of the carrier phase estimator in high-speed intradyne coherent optical receivers. This work investigates the performance of the JIDD algorithm in multi-gigabit optical coherent receivers. We present simulation results of bit error rate (BER) for non-differential polarization division multiplexing (PDM)-16QAM modulation in a 200 Gb/s coherent optical system that includes an LDPC code with 20% overhead and net coding gain of 11.3 dB at BER = 10-15. Our study shows that JIDD with a pilot rate ≤ 5% compensates for both laser phase noise and laser frequency fluctuation. Furthermore, since JIDD is used with non-differential modulation formats, we find that gains in excess of 1 dB can be achieved over existing solutions based on an explicit carrier phase estimator with differential modulation. The impact of the fiber nonlinearities in dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) systems is also investigated. Our results demonstrate that JIDD is an excellent candidate for application in next generation high-speed optical coherent receivers. Copyright © 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.},

In the popular selective feedback scheme, each user feeds back CSI about only its strongest SC to the base station (BS). We focus on the less studied, but practically important problem of transmitting reliably even on SCs that are fed back by no user or few users. We derive a constrained, non-linear minimum mean square error estimator that enables the BS to estimate the power gains of all the unreported SCs of a user. The novelty of the estimator lies in its exploitation of the structure of feedback generated by the selective feedback scheme. It improves the average cell throughput compared to several conventional approaches - without any additional feedback overhead. The improvements occur for both uncorrelated and correlated SCs, and for the channel-aware greedy and fair round-robin schedulers. © 2015 IEEE.},

	abstract = {A method of active acoustic resonance interference spectroscopy is introduced for estimation of bubble properties. A modified form of Rayleigh-Plesset equation for forced oscillation of either a single free bubble or elastic shell encapsulated microbubble with attached solids loading is solved by the regular perturbation method for steady oscillatory solutions as a result of small amplitude acoustic excitation by a point sinusoidal oscillator. A model for the total pressure field at an acoustic receiver in an incompressible liquid is then solved by the regular perturbation method. Closed-form analytical solutions are found for pressure power at the acoustic receiver as a function of the excitation frequency and strength; the properties of the bubble, liquid, and encapsulating shell; and the geometry of the active monitoring system. The receiver pressure power exhibits a maximum due to bubble resonance and a minimum due to destructive interference between source and bubble response pressure fields at higher excitation frequencies. The inverse problem is solved to derive unique closed-form analytical estimators for bubble equilibrium size, attached solids mass loading, and encapsulating layer dilatational viscosity as a function of the frequencies of the fundamental resonance maximum, interference minimum, second harmonic maximum total average acoustic power, monitoring system, and phase properties. © 2015 Acoustical Society of America.},

	abstract = {A novel hybrid channel estimator that gives robust performance with respect to the error in antenna-to-subcarrier assignment (ATSA) for spatially correlated MIMO-OFDM system with per-subcarrier transmit antenna, is proposed. In practice, the antenna selection information is transmitted through a binary symmetric control channel with a crossover probability. Though minimum mean-square error (MMSE) estimator performs well at low signal to noise ratio (SNR), in the presence of antenna selection error it introduces irreducible error at high SNR. In this paper, we have proved that relaxed MMSE estimator overcomes the performance degradation at high SNR, with less computational complexity. The proposed hybrid estimator combines the benefit of MMSE at low SNR and relaxed MMSE estimator at high SNR. Further, an analytical expression for SNR threshold at which the hybrid estimator is to be switched from MMSE to relaxed MMSE is also derived. The simulation results show that the proposed hybrid estimator gives robust performance, irrespective of the ATSA error and power delay profile of the channel. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

	abstract = {Direct-conversion radio receivers can offer highly integrated low-cost hardware solutions for cognitive radio (CR) devices. Such receivers are, however, also very sensitive to various radio frequency (RF) impairments such as IQ imbalance, which can considerably limit the spectrum sensing capabilities. Most of the existing spectrum sensing studies in literature assume an ideal RF receiver and hence neglect the impacts of such practical RF hardware limitations. In this article, we study energy detection (ED) based spectrum sensing in both single-channel and multi-channel direct-conversion receiver scenarios impaired by IQ imbalance. With complex Gaussian primary user (PU) signal models, we first derive the detection and false alarm probabilities in closed-form for both receiver scenarios. The analytical results, confirmed through extensive simulations, show that while the single-channel receiver scenario is fairly robust to IQ imbalance, the wideband multi-channel sensing receiver is very sensitive to the image channel crosstalk induced by IQ imbalance. More specifically, it is shown that the false alarm probability of multi-channel energy detection increases significantly, compared to ideal RF receiver case, and the exact performance depends on the image channel power level and IQ imbalance values. In order to prevent such degradation in the ability to identify free spectrum, a waveform level interference cancellation method is then proposed to mitigate the image channel crosstalk. The optimum cancellation coefficient yielding interference-free signal is first derived, being also complemented with a practical coefficient sample estimator. An explicit condition is also derived for which the proposed cancellation scheme deploying the practical coefficient sample estimator provides performance gain in the sensing decisions compared to uncompensated energy detection. Extensive computer simulations with various signal and imbalance conditions are provided which demonstrate that the proposed enhanced energy detection can suppress the image channel crosstalk efficiently, yielding detection and false alarm probabilities essentially identical to those of an ideal RF receiver. © 1983-2012 IEEE.},

Known CDR estimators are formulated in a common framework, illustrated using a geometric interpretation in the complex plane, and investigated with respect to bias and robustness towards model errors. Several novel unbiased CDR estimators are proposed, and it is shown that knowledge of either the direction of arrival (DOA) of the target source or the coherence of the noise field is sufficient for unbiased CDR estimation. The validity of the model for the application of CDR estimates to dereverberation is investigated using measured and simulated impulse responses. A CDR-based dereverberation system is presented and evaluated using signal-based quality measures as well as automatic speech recognition accuracy. The results show that the proposed unbiased estimators have a practical advantage over existing estimators, and that the proposed DOA-independent estimator can be used for effective blind dereverberation. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {A new combinatorial impairment-compensation digital predistorter (DPD) for a sub-GHz IEEE 802.11af-WLAN CMOS transmitter (TX) is proposed. For the TX to cover a 10x-wide bandwidth, the DPD implements a modified dynamic deviation reduction (DDR)-based Volterra series to jointly nullify the frequency-dependent I/Q imbalance, counter-intermodulation (CIM) of mixers, and nonlinearities of power amplifier (PA) with memory effect. The interactions of those impairments are firstly analyzed using two Volterra series. After applying the tandem properties of Volterra series, interactions of all impairments can be described in one Volterra series by bonding those impairments in parallel. Coefficients of the DPD are extracted with the Least- Square (LS) estimator, achieving lower running complexity than the existing DPDs, which were developed to handle the PA nonlinearities only. Verifications are based on both system-level simulations and silicon measurements of a 65-nm CMOS TX prototype. When the TX delivers a 6-MHz bandwidth, 2048-point, 64-QAM OFDM signal at > +10 dBm output power, the measured EVM is <3.7% and adjacent channel leakage ratio (ACLR) is < -40.2 dBc under individual DPD applied at each RF. A novel one-shot calibration for reuse in the entire TV-band is demonstrated also, showing EVM <4.2% and ACLR < -39.8 dBc. © 2004-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Smart grids have urged a radical reappraisal of distribution networks and power quality requirements, which demand to continuously monitor grid conditions. This allows for early classification of power quality degeneration. In this context, this paper proposes an improved algorithm for phasor estimation and fault type classification in smart grid applications. The proposed algorithm is specifically composed of two steps: first, the phasor estimation from the input signals, which can be executed on the Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU). While step two concerns the fault type classification using the pha-sor estimation. Specifically, we propose to estimate the phasor parameters, (frequency, amplitude and initial phase) using least square method. Then, fault type classification is obtained using symmetrical component algorithm. The proposed algorithm can be used for the identification of power quality disturbances. It has been evaluated, compared, and studied with simulated data. Simulation results show accurate phasor estimations and accurate fault type classification in presence of noise. © 2015 IEEE.},

This algorithm can be considered as a generalization to both windowing and dynamic waveform model of the well-known three-parameter sine-fitting (3PSF) algorithm when the waveform offset is assumed to be null. The analytical expressions for the phasor, frequency, and Rate Of Change of Frequency (ROCOF) are derived. Several computer simulations performed under different steady-state and dynamic conditions compliant with the IEEE Standard C37.118.1-2011 about synchrophasor measurements for power systems and its related Amendment IEEE Standard C37.118.1a-2014 show that the real-valued and the classical complex-valued TWLS algorithms return the same results. However, the real-valued approach requires a lower processing effort. Furthermore, the accuracies of sine-wave amplitude and phase estimates returned by the real-valued TWLS algorithms as well as the 3PSF algorithm when the analyzed waveform is affected by different static or dynamic disturbances are compared by means of simulations. The achieved results show that the proposed algorithm provides more accurate results than both the classical 3PSF algorithm and its generalization based on data windowing. © 2014 IEEE.},

The feasibility of RFID tags for positioning and localization applications is studied here and a comparison to WLAN system is done. An indoor localization system based on the received signal strength (RSS) measurement requires the determination of the suitable path-loss model of the measurement environment for creating a low complexity positioning estimators. In this paper the path-loss model and its parameters, using an embroidered passive RFID tag is introduced. The backscattered power measurement of the embroidered passive tag on human body, for certain measurement points, in indoor environment, is performed. The path-loss model is calculated utilizing the collected RSS data and deconvolution approaches. We show that the RFID RSS values are slightly more stable than the WLAN RSS values (i.e., lower shadowing variance) and that the two-parameter path-loss models are suitable to characterize the RFID RSS fluctuations. © 2014 IEEE.},

Conventional ranging methods rely on a two-step approach: range related parameters, such as the time of arrival (TOA), the bias induced by non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagations etc., are first estimated, based on which the range is then inferred. In multi-path conditions, two-step range estimators which employ the correlator-based estimator or the energy detector lead to poor ranging accuracy when applied in non-ultra-wideband scenarios due to bias. More advanced ranging schemes that estimate all multi-path components using a multidimensional search procedure provide higher ranging accuracy but have a prohibitive complexity. In this work, we propose a novel direct ranging technique that uses a point process formulated channel model. Based on this model, we derive an approximate maximum likelihood estimator of the range. In contrast to the estimator which requires a multidimensional search procedure, the proposed estimator does not demand the knowledge of the exact number of multi-path components and these components are separable. If the power delay spectrum of the multi-path channel and the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) are known, the complexity of the proposed estimator is tractable. We show by means of Monte Carlo simulations that this estimator outperforms the correlator-based estimator. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {We present two estimators to quantify the angular power spectrum of the sky signal directly from the visibilities measured in radio interferometric observations. This is relevant for both the foregrounds and the cosmological 21-cm signal buried therein. The discussion here is restricted to the Galactic synchrotron radiation, the most dominant foreground component after point source removal. Our theoretical analysis is validated using simulations at 150 MHz, mainly for GMRT and also briefly for Low-Frequency Array. The Bare Estimator uses pairwise correlations of the measured visibilities, while the Tapered Gridded Estimator uses the visibilities after gridding in the uv plane. The former is very precise, but computationally expensive for large data. The latter has a lower precision, but takes less computation time which is proportional to the data volume. The latter also allows tapering of the sky response leading to sidelobe suppression, an useful ingredient for foreground removal. Both estimators avoid the positive bias that arises due to the system noise. We consider amplitude and phase errors of the gain, and the w-term as possible sources of errors. We find that the estimated angular power spectrum is exponentially sensitive to the variance of the phase errors but insensitive to amplitude errors. The statistical uncertainties of the estimators are affected by both amplitude and phase errors. The w-term does not have a significant effect at the angular scales of our interest. We propose the Tapered Gridded Estimator as an effective tool to observationally quantify both foregrounds and the cosmological 21-cm signal. © 2014 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.},

	abstract = {Channel estimation algorithms and their implementations for mobile receivers are considered in this paper. The 3GPP long term evolution (LTE) based pilot structure is used as a benchmark in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) receiver. The decision directed (DD) space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm is used to improve the performance from that of the pilot symbol based least-squares (LS) channel estimator. The performance is improved with high user velocities, where the pilot symbol density is not sufficient. Minimum mean square error (MMSE) filtering is also used in estimating the channel in between pilot symbols. The pilot overhead can be reduced to a third of the LTE pilot overhead with DD channel estimation, obtaining a ten percent increase in data throughput. Complexity reduction and latency issues are considered in the architecture design. The pilot based LS, MMSE and the SAGE channel estimators are implemented with a high level synthesis tool, synthesized with the UMC 0.18 μm CMOS technology and the performance-complexity trade-offs are studied. The MMSE estimator improves the performance from the simple LS estimator with LTE pilot structure and has low power consumption. The SAGE estimator has high power consumption but can be used with reduced pilot density to increase the data rate. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

	abstract = {Super-resolution is a fundamental task in imaging, where the goal is to extract fine-grained structure from coarsegrained measurements. Here we are interested in a popular mathematical abstraction of this problem that has been widely studied in the statistics, signal processing and machine learning communities. We exactly resolve the threshold at which noisy super-resolution is possible. In particular, we establish a sharp phase transition for the relationship between the cutoff frequency (m) and the separation (Δ). If m > 1/Δ + 1, our estimator converges to the true values at an inverse polynomial rate in terms of the magnitude of the noise. And when m < (1 - ∈)/Δ no estimator can distinguish between a particular pair of Δ-separated signals even if the magnitude of the noise is exponentially small. Our results involve making novel connections between extremal functions and the spectral properties of Vandermonde matrices. We establish a sharp phase transition for their condition number which in turn allows us to give the first noise tolerance bounds for the matrix pencil method. Moreover we show that our methods can be interpreted as giving preconditioners for Vandermonde matrices, and we use this observation to design faster algorithms for super-resolution. We believe that these ideas may have other applications in designing faster algorithms for other basic tasks in signal processing. © Copyright 2015 ACM.},

	abstract = {As part of the African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis (AMMA) field campaign an X-band dual-polarization Doppler radar was deployed in Benin, West-Africa, in 2006 and 2007, together with a reinforced rain gauge network and several optical disdrometers. Based on this data set, a comparative study of several rainfall estimators that use X-band polarimetric radar data is presented. In tropical convective systems as encountered in Benin, microwave attenuation by rain is significant and quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE) at X-band is a challenge. Here, several algorithms based on the combined use of reflectivity, differential reflectivity and differential phase shift are evaluated against rain gauges and disdrometers. Four rainfall estimators were tested on twelve rainy events: the use of attenuation corrected reflectivity only (estimator R(ZH)), the use of the specific phase shift only R(KDP), the combination of specific phase shift and differential reflectivity R(KDP,ZDR) and an estimator that uses three radar parameters R(ZH,ZDR,KDP). The coefficients of the power law relationships between rain rate and radar variables were adjusted either based on disdrometer data and simulation, or on radar-gauges observations. The three polarimetric based algorithms with coefficients predetermined on observations outperform the R(ZH) estimator for rain rates above 10mm/h which explain most of the rainfall in the studied region. For the highest rain rates (above 30mm/h) R(KDP) shows even better scores, and given its performances and its simplicity of implementation, is recommended. The radar based retrieval of two parameters of the rain drop size distribution, the normalized intercept parameter NW and the volumetric median diameter Dm was evaluated on four rainy days thanks to disdrometers. The frequency distributions of the two parameters retrieved by the radar are very close to those observed with the disdrometer. NW retrieval based on a combination of ZH-KDP-ZDR works well whatever the a priori assumption made on the drop shapes. Dm retrieval based on ZDR alone performs well, but if satisfactory ZDR measurements are not available, the combination ZH-KDP provides satisfactory results for both Dm and NW if an appropriate a priori assumption on drop shape is made. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {We present the rationale, design features, and protocol of the Personalized Risk Estimator for Rheumatoid Arthritis (PRE-RA) Family Study (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02046005). The PRE-RA Family Study is an NIH-funded prospective, randomized controlled trial designed to compare the willingness to change behaviors in first-degree relatives of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients without RA after exposure to RA risk educational programs. Consented subjects are randomized to receive education concerning their personalized RA risk based on demographics, RA-associated behaviors, genetics, and biomarkers or to receive standard RA information. Four behavioral factors associated with RA risk were identified from prior studies for inclusion in the risk estimate: cigarette smoking, excess body weight, poor oral health, and low fish intake. Personalized RA risk information is presented through an online tool that collects data on an individual's specific age, gender, family history, and risk-related behaviors; presents genetic and biomarker results; displays relative and absolute risk of RA; and provides personalized feedback and education. The trial outcomes will be changes in willingness to alter behaviors from baseline to 6. weeks, 6. months, and 12. months in the three intervention groups. The design and the execution of this trial that targets a special population at risk for RA, while incorporating varied risk factors into a single risk tool, offer distinct challenges. We provide the theoretical rationale for the PRE-RA Family Study and highlight particular design features of this trial that utilize personalized risk education as an intervention. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Precise positioning on a medium earth orbit (MEO) seems to be less demanding than on earth due to the lack of atmospheric delays and the reduced signal shadowing by earth. Nevertheless there are several challenges for positioning on very high altitudes like high Doppler shift or the limited signal visibility due to out-of-lobe areas. While signal visibility, especially in higher altitudes, has improved and will further improve due to the increasing number of GNSS satellites, receiver adjustments are still needed for that environment beside considerations regarding tolerance of cosmic radiation. Off-the-shelf receivers do not provide navigation informaion at velocities exceeding 600 m/s due to dual-use reaons. Satellites on an earth orbit move with more than 7000 m/s on low altitudes and even still more than 3000 m/s on a geosynchronous orbit. On an eccentric orbit even higher maximum speeds can be reached, which excludes off-the-shelf receivers (even in a simulation environment) from orbit based applications. The Institute of Flight Guidance (IFF) has developed a software based GNSS receiver. It is implemented in C++, while the receiver tracking routines are based on NVIDIA CUDA and enable the receiver to track several dozens of signals in real-time, depending on the GPU processing power as shown at the ION GNSS 2012 ([1]). The digiized signals can be provided by different types of receiver front-ends and are sent to the receiver via USB. The receiver is able to process GPS, Galileo and SBAS signals. Since software based solution is fully adaptable to special applications, it can be adjusted for precise positioning on an earth orbit as well. The receiver has particularly been adapted with respect to signal availability and accuracy in order to fit the requirements on an earth orbit. The tracking has been changed from scalar control procedures to a vector based code and carrier frequency tracking routine, in which a Kalman based state estimator controls the tracking states. Since the movement on an orbit can be predicted very precisely, a dynamic model has been derived to describe the Kepler mechanics and therefore reduce the average measurement residuals in the correction step of the Kalman filter. In order to estimate the influence of the receiver dynamic on the measurements, maximum values for Doppler shift and Doppler rate were derived for worst-case scenarios. Further considerations in this paper are due to relativistic effects on the Doppler measurements. Copyright © (2014) by the Institute of Navigation All rights reserved.},

Accordingly, this paper investigates a frequency domain iterative estimator for SNR and Doppler shift in mobile communications, where the discrete cosine transform (DCT) is operated to the band-limited fading channel corrupted by the additive white gaussian noise (AWGN), and then the power spectrum density (PSD) of fading channels can be extracted from the calculated frequency domain samples. With the PSD estimation, we can iteratively estimate the noise variance and the spectrum width in an interlocked manner, where the former is related to SNR and the latter corresponds to the Doppler shift. Moreover, since DCT causes few spectrum leakages than the conventional fast fourier transform, the proposed method can converge within few iterations. We verify our algorithm by simulations and observe high accuracy in a wide range of velocities and SNRs. © 2014 IEEE.},

A general model for the zero, positive, and negative sequences from a PMU measurement at off-nominal frequencies is presented and a hypothesis testing framework is formulated.

A general model for the symmetrical sequences from a PMU measurement at off-nominal frequencies is presented. The new formulation takes into account the fact that minor degree of imbalance in the system is acceptable and does not indicate interruptions, failures, or degradation of physical components. Therefore, a generalization of the locally most powerful test (LMP), named the generalized LMP (GLMP) test, is developed for local detection in the presence of additional nuisance parameters. The GLMP concept is similar to that of the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) and is obtained by substituting the maximum likelihood (ML) estimators of the nuisance parameters into the LMP test.

	abstract = {Vibration appears in many technological fields, sometimes as part of the process itself, and sometimes as an undesired consequence of the system function. In all cases, the presence of these oscillations can result in structural fatigue issues or in reduction of the system performance, like it is the case of tracking problems in robotic arms or measuring devices, like big moving telescopes. Aeronautical structures are especially sensitive to vibration problems. Their light nature and the presence of periodic and non-periodic perturbations, which are caused at a large extent by the propellers, are responsible for the transmission of vibration power inside the cabin resulting in noise and comfort problems to add to the previous mentioned fatigue issues. Vibration damping mechanisms are used in aeronautic structures, mainly as passive elements for isolating the sources of oscillation like rubbers or springs, or by means of tuned mass dampers. However, passive approaches have performance limitations. Their passive character makes them unable to adapt themselves to changing conditions, and they are normally restricted to certain frequencies of operation. For these reasons, active solutions have gained interest during the last years. These solutions require the use of actuators capable of entering power in the system. Examples of this trend are: piezoelectric patches for high frequency noise cancellation in cabin or in rotor blades; hydraulic actuators for structural damping, among others. The solutions normally apply speed or acceleration feedback signals for modifying the effective mass or structural damping. The approach we are describing in the present paper investigates the improvements that can be obtained by the use of more advanced monitoring capabilities for identifying the perturbation affecting the structure. This solution tries to avoid reacting to the effects of the perturbation, but compensating them as soon as possible, therefore minimizing the undesired effects. This is done by combining model based observers with sensors and actuators in the structure. In combination to the use of estimators, learning algorithms can improve the performance of the damping system by predicting the perturbation to arrive and therefore actuating at the same instant it appears. This approach is intended to reduce the sampling restrictions from pure estimating solutions. Copyright © 2015 by DEStech Publica tions, Inc.},

The proposed dynamic estimators estimate amplitudes and phase angles of the current injected by the grid at the point of common coupling with the distributed generation (DG) in addition to the DG's bus voltage. A distributed two-level algorithm is proposed to detect an islanding condition for single and multi-DG configurations. Analytical design and transient analysis are carried out for the islanding detection problem to determine the nondetection zone (NDZ) of the proposed islanding detection algorithm. A local low-frequency meshed communication network is sufficient to achieve distributed islanding detection capability for a general multi-DG network with negligible NDZ. It is shown through simulations that the proposed IDM can successfully distinguish an islanding condition from other disturbances that may occur in power system networks. © 2014 IEEE.},

While most of the PMUs used nowadays in transmission networks rely on static phasor models, more sophisticated representations and stricter accuracy requirements are needed to track amplitude, phase, and frequency changes of power waveforms in strongly dynamic scenarios as those expected in future distribution systems. In this paper, a discrete Fourier transform (DFT)-based algorithm based on a dynamic phasor model (referred to as interpolated dynamic DFT-based synchrophasor estimator) is used to estimate not only amplitude and phase of the collected waveforms, but also their frequency and rate of change of frequency. The performances of the proposed method are evaluated through multiple simulations in different steady-state and transient conditions described in the Standard IEEE C37.118.1-2011. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Perceptual audio codecs apply psychoacoustic principles such as masking effects of the human auditory system in order to reduce irrelevancies in the input audio signal. Psychoacoustic studies show differences between masking strength of tonal and noise maskers: the masking effect of narrowband noise is stronger than that of a tone which has the same power and is placed in the center frequency of the noise. In this paper, two tonality estimation methods are discussed which are implemented in a filter bank based psychoacoustic model. The first method is called Partial Spectral Flatness Measure (PSFM) and the second is referred to as Amplitude Modulation Ratio (AM-R). The psychoacoustic model uses a set of complex band-pass filters. It was designed according to the temporal/spectral resolution of the human auditory system, and takes into account post masking as well as the spreading effect of individual local maskers in simultaneous masking. This paper describes the model, tonality estimation methods and their implementation. The estimators are compared to each other by subjective tests. The results are presented and discussed. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {For many decades, state estimation (SE) has been a critical technology for energy management systems utilized by power system operators. Over time, it has become a mature technology that provides an accurate representation of system state under fairly stable and well understood system operation. The integration of variable energy resources (VERs) such as wind and solar generation, however, introduces new fast frequency dynamics and uncertainties into the system. Furthermore, such renewable energy is often integrated into the distribution system thus requiring real-time monitoring all the way to the periphery of the power grid topology and not just the (central) transmission system. The conventional solution is two fold: solve the SE problem (1) at a faster rate in accordance with the newly added VER dynamics and (2) for the entire power grid topology including the transmission and distribution systems. Such an approach results in exponentially growing problem sets which need to be solver at faster rates. This work seeks to address these two simultaneous requirements and builds upon two recent SE methods which incorporate event-triggering such that the state estimator is only called in the case of considerable novelty in the evolution of the system state. The first method incorporates only event-triggering while the second adds the concept of tracking. Both SE methods are demonstrated on the standard IEEE 14-bus system and the results are observed for a specific bus for two difference scenarios: (1) a spike in the wind power injection and (2) ramp events with higher variability. Relative to traditional state estimation, the numerical case studies showed that the proposed methods can result in computational time reductions of 90%. These results were supported by a theoretical discussion of the computational complexity of three SE techniques. The work concludes that the proposed SE techniques demonstrate practical improvements to the computational complexity of classical state estimation. In such a way, state estimation can continue to support the necessary control actions to mitigate the imbalances resulting from the uncertainties in renewables. © 2014 ISA.},

In particular, the effect on estimation accuracy of both the observation interval length and the number of acquired samples/nominal cycle is analyzed by considering as worst case the mean plus twice the standard deviation of the estimation errors. The achieved values are compared with the results achieved when processing noiseless waveforms and the thresholds specified in the above Standards documents. The performed comparison shows that the impact of wideband noise on the estimated phasor parameters can be relevant even though the signal-to-noise ratio is quite high. © 2014 AEIT.},

The proposed method presented great accuracy and fast convergence for a wide range of different operational conditions involving transitory events of frequency deviation, amplitude variations, signal phase shifts and stable power swings. In addition, signals distorted by noises, harmonics and inter-harmonics were also tested. In order to demonstrate the quality of the new frequency estimator in each analyzed case, its estimation was compared with the responses obtained by four other methods, in terms of performance indices based on the estimation of transitory error and response convergence time.

In such a system, the spectral sidelobes of the active subcarriers interfere with the adjacent spectral band used by the primary system. In the proposed scheme, the code generator matrix of the UW-OFDM is designed to suppress the sidelobes. So, there is no need to add any extra processing to the transmitter for suppressing sidelobes. The derived code generator matrix is optimum in the sense of being matched to the best linear unbiased estimator and to the linear minimum mean square error data estimators. The achieved sidelobe suppression is a function of the number of transmitted data symbols. Simulation results show that by a slight decrease in the number of transmitted data symbols, the sidelobes power can be suppressed to zero. © VDE VERLAG GMBH, Berlin, Offenbach, Germany.},

	abstract = {In optimal prediction as well as in optimal smoothing the variance of the optimal estimator is impacted predominantly by the frequency segments where the power spectrum is small or negligible. Indeed, the Szegö's celebrated theorem characterizes deterministic process as those whose power spectral density fails to be log-integrable by virtue of sufficiently flat spectral zeros. Likewise Kolmogorov's formula gives an analogous condition for optimal smoothing. We discuss how the flatness of spectral zeros suggests a nested stratification of families of spectral where estimation of a stochastic process over a window of a given size is possible with negligible variance based on observations outside the interval. We then focus on the more general problem of estimating missing data in observation records which are not necessarily contiguous. A key result in the paper (Theorem 3) provides a sufficient condition for being able to estimate missing data with arbitrarily small error variance, in terms of the flatness of the spectral zeros. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Given the side effects and possible complications of current clinical treatments for severe pathological tremor, many researchers pursue the less invasive alternative of suppression at the musculo-skeletal level. In wearable robotics applications, the high strength-to-weight ratio, the low power consumption, and their adaptability allow magnetorheological (MR) fluid dampers and actuators to be personalized to the individual needs of a patient. Moreover, their rapid dynamic response makes them suitable for use in real time active devices. This paper presents the theoretical development and experimental validation of a tremor suppression control algorithm based on a dynamic lump parameter model of the MR damper and a real time adaptive tremor frequency estimator. The control strategy was experimentally evaluated using a one-DOF joint simulator. Experiments with ten datasets from patients with severe Parkinsonian and Essential Tremor show suppressions for the first and second harmonics of 28.7±2.2 dB and 11.8±4.8 dB, respectively. These results compare favorably with the suppression levels obtained by other researchers using constant current approach. In addition, the resistance that the orthotic device imposes to the voluntary motion was reduced by 33% under the active control strategy, while the power usage was dramatically reduced by nearly an order of magnitude. © 2015 by ASME.},

Self-clutter is caused by simultaneous returns from multiple transmitted pulses echoing from unwanted, or ambiguous ranges. Without accurate estimates of self-clutter it is impossible to account for all the uncertainty in estimates of the radar ACF. Voltage- and power-based self-clutter estimators are presented and evaluated using a modified version of the radar data simulator of Ribeiro et al. (2013a) and data from the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN). It is shown that self-clutter caused by ambiguous ranges filled with ground scatter can be accurately estimated using a voltage-based self-clutter estimator but that for ionospheric origin self-clutter a maximal estimator must be used. Two maximal self-clutter estimators are discussed and verified using the radar data simulator. A discussion of the application of the self-clutter estimator as it is applied to ACFs obtained with Saskatoon SuperDARN radar is also presented. ©2015. American Geophysical Union.

	abstract = {This article presents two sets of channel estimation methods that employ soft input from the decoder to enhance channel estimation process for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing -interleave division multiple access (OFDMIDMA) system. The first channel estimation scheme exploits both time and frequency domains for channel estimation and prediction. The estimator exploits turbo principle while using iterative based sequential linear minimum mean square error (ISLMMSE) for channel transfer function (CTF) estimation, and regularised variable step size normalised least mean square (ℓ1-VSSNLMS) algorithm for channel impulse response (CIR) prediction. The channel estimation scheme exchanges information with the Multi-User Detector (MUD), and also employs soft information feedback from the decoder for the enhancement of channel estimation. The second iterative channel estimation scheme, in time domain, is based on regularised noise power estimate-based variable forgetting factor recursive least square (ℓ1-NPEVFF-RLS)-based CIR estimator. The performances of the proposed estimators are documented through computer simulation. Their comparative performances with other schemes in the literature are presented in this article. From the simulation results, the two proposed channel estimators exhibit better performance in comparison with other schemes in the literature, but with higher computational complexities. However, of the two proposed methods, the ℓ1-NPEVFF-RLS-based CIR estimator that exhibits almost the same performance as the combined ISLMMSE-based CTF estimator and ℓ1-VSSNLMS-based predictor exhibits lower computational complexity. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2014.},

The DPD module creates a correction signal using a set of nonlinear basis waveforms, weighted by adjustable coefficients. The coefficients are optimized using a closed-loop estimator. It is shown using superposition that the basis waveform sets used in the DPD module and closed-loop estimator can differ by a linear transformation, which includes filtering. By filtering the waveforms presented to the estimator, coefficients are optimized for distortion cancellation in a specific part of the spectrum corresponding to the observed bandwidth. The narrow bandwidth coefficient estimate provides wide bandwidth distortion cancellation when used by a DPD module having the unfiltered basis waveform set. Success of the approach relies on further filtering within the estimator to attenuate (notch) the input signal bandwidth, thereby reducing biases in the closed-loop estimation. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) over wireless channels is sensitive to carrier frequency offset (CFO), which destroys orthogonality amongst sub-carriers, giving rise to inter-carrier interference (ICI). Different techniques are available for estimating and compensating for the CFO at the receiver. However, in practice, a residual CFO remains at the receiver after CFO estimation, where the estimation accuracy depends primarily on the fractions of time and power used by the estimator. In this paper, we propose to measure the efficiency of OFDM systems with CFO estimation errors in terms of the spectral efficiency, which accounts for both, the degradation in signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR) due to the residual CFO, and the penalty of the extra power and spectral resources allocated to achieve the desired CFO estimation accuracy. New accurate expressions are derived for the spectral efficiency of wireless OFDM systems in the presence of residual CFO and frequency-selective multipath fading channel. These are used to compare between two common CFO estimation methods in wireless OFDM systems, namely, the cyclic prefix based and the training symbols based CFO estimation techniques for fixed and variable pilot power. These results are further extended to include OFDM systems with transmit diversity techniques. In addition, the impact of imperfect channel estimation on the overall spectral efficiency is also included. Numerical results reveal that the cyclic prefix based CFO technique is more efficient than the training symbols based CFO technique when perfect channel state information (CSI) is known blindly at the receiver. Furthermore, fixed pilot power results in a spectral efficiency ceiling as SNR increases, whereas spectral efficiency increases with SNR without bound in the equal pilot and signal powers case. © 1972-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The goal of the MICROSCOPE space mission, scheduled for launch in 2016, is the test the Weak Equivalence Principle (WEP) with a precision of 10∼15. The signal of interest is the difference of the accelerations of two test-masses made with different materials. These accelerations are measured by ultra-sensitive electrostatic accelerometers onboard a micro-satellite equipped with a drag-free system. The challenge of the data processing is to find a violation signal at a well-defined frequency in data samples disrupted by deterministic perturbations and colored noise. To achieve this objective, we perform a regression analysis to estimate the WEP violation as well as instrument parameters. A long integration period corresponding to several orbits is needed to reach a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio. However, in flight, the measurement may suffer from numerous interruptions due to various causes: saturation events due to crackles of the thrusters tanks or the multilayer insulation coating, micrometeorite impacts, and telemetry losses. We investigate the effect of these gaps on the performance of the WEP test and show that they cause a significant frequency leakage of the noise power. We present a regression method which cancels this effect and enables us to estimate the parameters of interest with a precision comparable to the complete data case, even if the noise power spectral density is not known a priori. The method is based on an autoregressive fit of the noise, which allows us to build a general least squares estimator approaching the minimal variance bound. We apply this method to simulated measurements of the instrument in orbit, and show that it increases the precision by a factor 60 with respect to ordinary least squares estimators. This analysis validates the integration times, the mission scenario and the processing tools to be implemented in the Scientific Mission Center. In addition the outputs of the algorithm are used to faithfully reconstruct the signal in the missing intervals. While the proposed approach is applied to MICROSCOPE simulated data, it provides a robust method to estimate one or several deterministic components in the general context of time series with missing data affected by unknown colored noise.},

	abstract = {Experimental methods based on modal analysis under ambient vibrational excitation are often employed to detect structural damages of mechanical systems. Many of such frequency domain methods, such as Basic Frequency Domain (BFD), Frequency Domain Decomposition (FFD), or Enhanced Frequency Domain Decomposition (EFFD), use as first step a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) estimate of the power spectral density (PSD) associated with the response of the system. In this study it is shown that higher order statistical estimators such as Spectral Kurtosis (SK) and Sample to Model Ratio (SMR) may be successfully employed not only to more reliably discriminate the response of the system against the ambient noise fluctuations, but also to better identify and separate contributions from closely spaced individual modes. It is shown that a SMR-based Maximum Likelihood curve fitting algorithm may improve the accuracy of the spectral shape and location of the individual modes and, when combined with the SK analysis, it provides efficient means to categorize such individual spectral components according to their temporal dynamics as harmonic or stochastic system responses to unknown ambient excitations. © 2015, International Society for Structural Health Monitoring of Intelligent Infrastructure, ISHMII.

In real application, the scene is towards one continuous monotonous direction and has different appearances of non-uniformity. Under this consideration, a scene-based non-uniformity correction technology was proposed, it not only fitted the situation mentioned above but also was realized on the small packaged, low power consumed real-time hardware system. These problems were solved by developing a new projection estimator for the registration with a criterion, and this algorithm was immigrated into a FPGA_based hardware system. This system is fully engineered for some particular usage. The performance of the proposed technology was tested by the evaluation indexes, and it demonstrates the actual effect of correcting the non-uniformity under a monotonous motion on the system. According to the practical application, this algorithm has the advantage of the strong ability to eliminate the image degradation and fast convergence speed.},

	abstract = {Accurate channel estimation is necessary before we can demodulate orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals since the radio channel is frequency-selective and time-varying for wideband mobile communication systems. For pilot-symbol-aided channel estimation, pilot sequences are inserted periodically into the data stream enabling coherent detection at receiver. The control signal information can be embedded in pilot sequences and transmitted implicitly in OFDM systems to save the bandwidth. In order to estimate the channel and control signal jointly at the receiver, we propose a novel noise subspace based method in this paper. The proposed method is developed from the DFT-based channel estimator. If the hypothesized sequence coincides with the transmitted pilot sequence, the last part of the channel impulse response (CIR) estimate is only contributed by Gaussian noise and its average power is expected to be the minimum among all possible hypothesized sequences. Simulation results show that the proposed method works well in any of the channels even if integer carrier frequency offset (CFO) is considered.

	abstract = {Small signal stability is a crucial aspect of accurately keeping control in modern interconnected power systems, in order to ensure the required security and reliability standards. Such an aspect could represent a serious limiting factor in the search for ever higher power system exploitation levels. Hence, in order to exploit the existing networks as much as possible, ensuring at the same time adequate security levels, the system operators must monitor the electromechanical oscillations continuously, estimating their fundamental parameters (e.g. frequency, damping factor/ratio, amplitude and phase), and determining the actual dynamic stability margins. Nowadays, electromechanical oscillations tracking can be performed in real time thanks to the quick development of wide area measurement/monitoring systems, and the employment of so-called measurement-based methods (a.k.a. mode meters). In this regard, the paper presents a performance comparison among several measurement-based methods currently operating on the Italian Wide Area Monitoring (WAM) platform. The main objective of this investigation is to analyze the behavior of each of them with respect to actual critical/not critical electromechanical oscillations recorded on the European Network Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-e) Continental Synchronous European System (CESA). The considered case studies cover a large variety of situations that can be encountered in the ordinary ENTSO-e CESA operation: local and inter-area oscillations; single mode and multi-mode power signals; ambient and ringdown data; and so on. By keeping in mind that usually no best estimator exists, owing to the lack of an optimality definition, the present analysis aims at examining whether some algorithms are generally more suitable than others, with respect to the variety of aforementioned situations. In detail, the measurement-based methods considered in this work are the Tufts-Kumaresan method, Hankel Singular Value Decomposition-VarPRO, Hilbert-Huang Transform, its refined Empirical Mode Decomposition with Fourier-Based Masking Technique (R-EMD), and a recently published Hilbert Transform-based estimation algorithm. Obviously, this set of estimation techniques cannot be considered exhaustive for the research problem under analysis. Nonetheless, it represents a collection of the major, recent and most fashionable methodologies implemented in actual WAM architectures. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Despite significant advances in adult clinical electrocardiography (ECG) signal processing techniques and the power of digital processors, the analysis of non-invasive foetal ECG (NI-FECG) is still in its infancy. The Physionet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2013 addresses some of these limitations by making a set of FECG data publicly available to the scientific community for evaluation of signal processing techniques. The abdominal ECG signals were first preprocessed with a band-pass filter in order to remove higher frequencies and baseline wander. A notch filter to remove power interferences at 50Hz or 60Hz was applied if required. The signals were then normalized before applying various source separation techniques to cancel the maternal ECG. These techniques included: template subtraction, principal/independent component analysis, extended Kalman filter and a combination of a subset of these methods (FUSE method). Foetal QRS detection was performed on all residuals using a Pan and Tompkins QRS detector and the residual channel with the smoothest foetal heart rate time series was selected. The FUSE algorithm performed better than all the individual methods on the training data set. On the validation and test sets, the best Challenge scores obtained were E1 = 179.44, E2 = 20.79, E3 = 153.07, E4 = 29.62 and E5 = 4.67 for events 1-5 respectively using the FUSE method. These were the best Challenge scores for E1 and E2 and third and second best Challenge scores for E3, E4 and E5 out of the 53 international teams that entered the Challenge. The results demonstrated that existing standard approaches for foetal heart rate estimation can be improved by fusing estimators together. We provide open source code to enable benchmarking for each of the standard approaches described. © 2014 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the detection of the fundamental frequency of power systems under unbalanced and distorted conditions. By using the second order information, both the autocorrelation and pseudo-autocorrelation, within the Clarke's transformed voltage, a novel balancing voltage transformation (BVT) is proposed to accurately detect the underlying phase angle evolution of the positive sequence component. This removes the biggest obstacle in current power systems and makes possible to use any frequency estimator for single-tone exponential on unbalanced power systems. The robustness of the proposed phase angle detection technique is illustrated for two well-known and efficient frequency estimators, that is, a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) coefficient interpolation method [1] and the weighted linear predictor (WLP) [2]. A window technique is used to cater for the fast and computationally affordable frequency estimation purposes. Simulations over a range of unbalanced conditions, including voltage dips and swells, frequency deviations and the presence of higher order harmonics support the analysis. © 2014 Asia-Pacific Signal and Information Processing Ass.},

	abstract = {Efficient digital transmission of analog speech, audio or video requires source coding which introduces unavoidable quantization errors. The bit stream produced by the source encoder needs to be protected against transmission errors by channel coding. The split of a given gross bit rate between source and channel coding is a compromise taking into account the design target of the worst case channel. Thus, even in clear channel conditions the quality of the decoded source signal is limited because of the quantization errors. Hybrid digital-analog (HDA) codes address this limitation by additionally transmitting the quantization error with quasi-analog methods (discrete-time, quasi-continuous-amplitude) with neither increasing the transmit power, nor the occupied frequency bandwidth on the radio channel. However, the decoding complexity of existing HDA codes is infeasible for the required block lengths. In this paper, the decoding complexity problem is solved by a new design approach. These HDA codes benefit from well-known digital codes. Furthermore, theoretical bounds are derived and explicit guidelines for the design of superior HDA systems are given. By experimental verification it is shown that the HDA concept may outperform conventional purely digital transmission systems at all channel qualities while additionally eliminating the quality saturation effect. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the polarization characteristics of specular and dense multipath components (SMC and DMC) in a large industrial hall based on frequency-domain channel sounding experiments at 1.3 GHz with 22-MHz bandwidth. Twenty-nine positions were measured under line-of-sight (LOS) and obstructed LOS (OLOS) scenarios. The RiMAX maximum-likelihood estimator is used to extract the full-polarimetric SMC and DMC from the measurement data by taking into account the polarimetric radiating patterns of the dual-polarized antennas. Cross-polar discrimination (XPD) and copolar ratio (CPR) values are presented from the measured and de-embedded channels, as well as the polarimetric delay and angular spread distributions. Strong de-embedded SMC depolarization is obtained for the horizontal polarization in OLOS scenarios. Additionally, DMC depolarization is observed to be weaker than previously reported for indoor environments but constant across LOS/OLOS, polarization, and distance. The results also show that the copolar (cross-polar) DMC power to total channel power ratio is equal to 15% (40%) for LOS and 40% (60%) for OLOS and that this ratio does not correlate significantly with transmitter-receiver distance. Finally, the validity of the room electromagnetics theory was confirmed for transmitter-receiver distances larger than 15 m with no significant difference between polarized subchannels. © 2014 IEEE.},

For almost all flux estimators, such as the flux estimator based on phase locked loop (PLL), DC drift causes fluctuations in flux magnitude. Furthermore, significant dynamic error may be introduced at transient conditions. To overcome these problems, this paper proposes an improved flux estimator for the PLL-based algorithm. Filters based on the generalized integrator are used to avoid flux fluctuation problems caused by the DC drift at the back electromotive force. Programmable low-pass filters are employed to improve the dynamic performance of the flux estimator, and the cutoff frequency of the filter is determined by the dynamic factor. The algorithm is verified by a 960V/1.6MW industrial prototype.

	abstract = {Synchrophasor technology is a growing area of interest for the electric power system. The technology is capable of fast, time-synchronized data that includes phase angles of the electrical measurements. When the energy management system (EMS) has access to the phasor representations of different electrical measurements, it opens the possibilities of more precise system monitoring. In the conventional measurement schemes, state estimation is dependent on magnitude measurements, power metering, low-resolution data, and physical estimates of grid facilities, such as transmission lines. It is not difficult to see that physical estimates of this expansive system can dramatically impact the accuracy of system monitoring. In this paper, data analysis and mathematical concepts are the primary methods of analysis. Measures for the evaluation involve frequency response, error measurements, and interference identification. In the analysis performed, it has been found that frequency can be directly linked to fault events. Also, the total vector error (TVE) of the synchrophasor data with respect to the conventional state estimations is near the compliant level of 1% for sufficient error tolerance. Although this is not a complete success, it does suggest that a synchrophasor-based state estimator scheme may very well support the compliance of the data. If the state estimator were supported by the high-resolution phasor measurements, this would conceivably satisfy the goals set forth by industry standards. Lastly, interference from storm conditions has also been analyzed, and some significant voltage disturbances were observed. These quick, detailed grid measurements could alleviate issues that have resulted from growing power system complexity. Synchrophasor technology has real potential for wide-area monitoring and system awareness. © 2015 IEEE.},

Therefore, this study gives insight to the design and implementation of the discrete wavelet transform (DWT)- based denoising technique for noise reduction of the DCV. The steps of denoising of noisy DCV for proposed study are follows. Firstly, by using the multi-resolution analysis (MRA), the noiseriding DCV signal is decomposed into different frequency subbands. Specifically, the signal processing considering high frequency component that focuses on short-time interval is absolutely necessary in order to reduce noise of the DCV. Secondly, the hard-thresholding based denoising technique is used to adjust the wavelet coefficients of the DWT for a clear separation between the signal and the noise. Thirdly, the desired de-noised DCV signal is reconstructed by taking the inverse DWT on filtered detailed coefficients. Consequently, this signal is applied to the equivalent circuit model (ECM)-based SOC estimation algorithm using the extended Kalman filter (EKF). Experimental results indicate the robustness of the proposed work. © 2015 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The acoustic response associated with squeal noise radiations is a hard issue due to the need to consider non-linearities of contact and friction, to solve the associated nonlinear dynamic problem and to calculate the noise emissions due to self-excited vibrations. In this work, the focus is on the calculation of the sound pressure in free space generated during squeal events. The calculation of the sound pressure can be performed by the Boundary Element Method (BEM). The inputs of this method are a boundary element model, a field of normal velocity characterized by a unique frequency. However, the field of velocity associated with friction-induced vibrations is composed of several harmonic components. So, the BEM equation has to be solved for each frequency and in most cases, the number of harmonic components is significant. Therefore, the computation time can be prohibitive. The reduction of the number of harmonic component is a key point for the quick estimation of the squeal noise. The proposed approach is based on the detection and the selection of the predominant harmonic components in the mean square velocity. It is applied on two cases of squeal and allows us to consider only few frequencies. In this study, a new method will be proposed in order to quickly well estimate the noise emission in free space. This approach will be based on an approximated acoustic power of brake system which is assumed to be a punctual source, an interpolated directivity and the decrease of the acoustic power levels. This method is applied on two classical cases of squeal with one and two unstable modes. It allows us to well reconstruct the acoustic power levels map. Several error estimators are introduced and show that the reconstructed field is close to the reference calculated with a complete BEM. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This article presents an overview of methods for spectrum interpolation and signal frequency estimation and a generalized method for very accurate and fast frequency grid estimation by using the Fast Fourier Transform procedure and maximum decay sidelobes windows.

	abstract = {Granger causality has long been a prominent method for inferring causal interactions between stochastic variables for a broad range of complex physical systems. However, it has been recognized that a moving average (MA) component in the data presents a serious confound to Granger causal analysis, as routinely performed via autoregressive (AR) modeling. We solve this problem by demonstrating that Granger causality may be calculated simply and efficiently from the parameters of a state-space (SS) model. Since SS models are equivalent to autoregressive moving average models, Granger causality estimated in this fashion is not degraded by the presence of a MA component. This is of particular significance when the data has been filtered, downsampled, observed with noise, or is a subprocess of a higher dimensional process, since all of these operations - commonplace in application domains as diverse as climate science, econometrics, and the neurosciences - induce a MA component. We show how Granger causality, conditional and unconditional, in both time and frequency domains, may be calculated directly from SS model parameters via solution of a discrete algebraic Riccati equation. Numerical simulations demonstrate that Granger causality estimators thus derived have greater statistical power and smaller bias than AR estimators. We also discuss how the SS approach facilitates relaxation of the assumptions of linearity, stationarity, and homoscedasticity underlying current AR methods, thus opening up potentially significant new areas of research in Granger causal analysis. © 2015 American Physical Society.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the accuracy of synchrophasor estimators provided by the interpolated discrete Fourier transform (IpDFT) algorithm under both steady-state and dynamic conditions when two- or three-cycle length observation intervals are considered. According to the IEEE Standard C37.118.1-2011 about synchrophasor measurements for power systems, the estimation accuracy is expressed by the total vector error (TVE). The effect on the estimation accuracy of different window functions, observation interval lengths, and processed DFT samples is analyzed through computer simulations. It is shown that most of the performance requirements specified in the Standard can be satisfied with a proper selection of the algorithm characteristics. Also, the performances of the proposed synchrophasor estimators and state-of-the-art estimators recently proposed in the scientific literature are compared and discussed. Some experimental results are presented in order to confirm the performed analysis. © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a performance comparison of two classes of synchrophasor estimators recently proposed in the literature, i.e., the frequency-domain algorithms known as interpolated discrete Fourier transform (IpDFT), and the time-domain algorithms based on the weighted least squares (WLSs) approach. The analysis is focused on fast phasor estimation only and it is performed under steady-state, dynamic, and transient conditions, when the length of the observation interval is equal to one or two nominal cycles of the acquired electric waveform. The considered testing conditions include not only the worst-case scenarios specified in the IEEE Standard C37.118.1-2011, but they also combine the effect of static and dynamic disturbances. As accuracy performance parameters, the total vector error as well as the amplitude and phase estimation errors are considered and evaluated. Estimator responsiveness is analyzed instead in terms of response times, when amplitude or phase steps occur. The preferable one- and two-cycles IpDFT and WLS algorithms are first determined by choosing the windows and the number of Taylor's series terms (in the WLS case only) assuring the best accuracy. It is shown that, when the time-domain approach is considered and one-cycle or two-cycle intervals are observed, the best accuracy is achieved by the WLS algorithm based on the rectangular window or the two-term one-cycle maximum image tone interference rejection (MIR) window, respectively. Conversely, when the frequency-domain approach is adopted, the best accuracy is achieved by the IpDFT-based on the MIR window related to the observed interval length. The estimates produced by the selected WLS and IpDFT algorithms are then compared against the boundaries specified in the Standard IEEE C37.118.1-2011 for P-and M-class compliance. During the discussion, advantages and disadvantages of both time-domain and frequency-domain approaches are highlighted. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {A key challenge in chip multiprocessor (CMP) design is to optimize the performance within a power budget limited by the CMP's cooling, packaging, and power supply capacities. Most existing solutions rely solely on dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) to adapt the power consumption of CPU cores, without coordinating with the last-level on-chip (e.g., L2) cache. This paper proposes DPPC, a chip-level power partitioning and control strategy that can dynamically and explicitly partition the chip-level power budget among different CPU cores and the shared last-level cache in a CMP based on the workload characteristics measured online. DPPC features a novel performance-power model and an online model estimator to quantitatively estimate the performance contributed by each core and the cache with their respective local power budgets. DPPC then re-partitions the chip-level power budget among them for optimized CMP performance. The partitioned local power budgets for the CPU cores and cache are precisely enforced by power control algorithms designed rigorously based on feedback control theory. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that DPPC achieves better CMP performance, within a given power budget, than several state-of-the-art power control solutions for both SPEC CPU2006 benchmarks and multi-threaded SPLASH-2 workloads. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Cognitive state estimation with the variation of physiological signal has drawn extensive attention from disciplines such as psychology, cognitive science and engineering. In this paper, we present a cognitive state classification system to assess the subject's mental states based on EEG measurements. The cognitive state estimator is utilized in the context of an augmented cognition system that aims to enhance the cognitive performance of a human user through computer-mediated assistance based on EEG. This paper focuses on the channel selection of the BIOPAC automated EEG analysis and feature extraction based on spectral analysis. Different frequency components (i) real value; (ii) imaginary value; (iii) magnitude; (iv) phase angle and (v) power spectral density of the EEG data samples in different mental conditions are selected for the estimation of cognitive states. In this approach seven types of cognitive states such as - relax, mental task, memory related task, motor action, pleasant, fear, and enjoying music are selected for feature extraction in the three channels - EEG, Alpha, and Alpha RMS of BIOPAC EEG data acquisition system. After feature extraction the channel efficacy are evaluated by support vector machine (SVM) which is based on the classification rate in different cognitive states. From experimental results and classification accuracy, it can be determined that alpha channel can be selected for cognitive state estimation. The overall accuracy for alpha channel shows much improved result for power spectral density and the classification rate is 69.17% whereas for EEG and alpha RMS channel it is found 47.22% and 32.21% respectively. © 2014 IEEE.},

This paper presents results from full-scale technology qualification testing of a power system onshore where the VSD is controlling a 188-Hz 7.8-MW gas compressor motor over a simulated distance of 47 km. The extensive testing shows that it is possible to control the compressor/motor speed from start-up throughout the whole load envelope without the need for motor voltage and current feedback. By the use of estimator-based control, it is also possible to provide motor overcurrent protection. This paper shows how resonances in the long cable system can be handled by the use of optimization of the generated voltage waveform instead of using a VSD sine filter. The successful technology qualification shows applicability for subsea compressors with a rated frequency of up to 200 Hz, at least 8-MW shaft power, and a step-out distance of at least 50 km. © 1972-2012 IEEE.},

We used stroboscope flashes with a 'chirp'-like linear frequency-increase from 10 to 40 Hz. EEG was recorded from occipital electrodes. Power spectral density was calculated for the stimulus response and corrected for baseline. An HR-estimator was calculated as the average power between 18 and 26 Hz in the stimulation-frequency window. Results: There was a significant difference for single (p>0.05) and for 10 averaged recordings (p>0.01) between migraineurs and controls, and a high inter-test reliability (Cronbach's alpha=0.94). Conclusion: Chirp-like stimulation to study the H-response is reliable and efficient and might therefore have a potential for acute interventional studies in migraine research. © 2014 International Headache Society.},

	abstract = {Future wireless devices have to support many applications (e.g., remote robotics, wireless automation, and mobile gaming) with extremely low latency and reliability requirements over wireless connections. Optimizing wireless transceivers while switching between wireless connections with different circuit characteristics requires addressing many hardware impairments that have been overlooked previously. For instance, switching between transmission and reception radio functions to facilitate time-division duplexing can change the load on the power supply. As the supply voltage changes in response to the sudden change in load, the carrier frequency drifts. Such a drift results in transient carrier frequency offset (CFO) that cannot be estimated by conventional CFO estimators and is typically addressed by inserting or extending guard intervals. In this paper, we explore the modeling and estimation of the transient CFO, which is modeled as the response of an underdamped second order system. To compensate for the transient CFO, we propose a low complexity parametric estimation algorithm, which uses the null space of the Hankel-like matrix constructed from phase difference of the two halves of the repetitive training sequence. Furthermore, to minimize the mean squared error of the estimated parameters in noise, a weighted subspace fitting algorithm is derived with a slight increase in complexity. The Crámer-Rao bound for any unbiased estimator of the transient CFO parameters is derived. The performance of the proposed algorithms is also confirmed by the experimental results obtained from the real wireless transceivers. © 2014 IEEE.},

In cluttered environment rich in multipath, RSS loss cannot reflect the true attenuation of power loss of LOS path, thus the performance of RTI deteriorates greatly. In this paper, we propose a new method referred to chirp-FFT approach to mitigate the multipath influence. In this approach, the nodes transmit wideband chirp signal to resolve the multipath. Because that the time of arrival (TOA) of paths are different, the received signal will contain multiple frequency components after demodulation. Then the demodulated signal can be transformed by FFT to separate the components and the first component corresponds to the LOS path. And we use an interpolator based estimator to accurately obtain the amplitude of LOS path. We simulate the performance of chirp-FFT approach in an environment with two paths. The results show that traditional RTI fails to locate the target at low SMR (signal to multipath ratio) while chirp-FFT approach works well at SMR up to -30dB. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {It is well known that channel impairment caused by multipath reflections can deeply degrade the transmission efficiency in wireless communication systems. The conventional DFT-based channel estimation methods improve the performance by neglecting nonsignificant channel taps. However, in multipath channels with non-sample-spaced time delays, this will cause power leakage and result in an error floor. In order to overcome this problem, based on the property of Channel impulse response, we describe a utility of channel estimation technology for OFDM systems using discriminant analysis. Usually, significant channel taps are detected on the basis of a predetermined threshold, so the optimal threshold value becomes a crucial factor. But it is difficult to decide channel taps that are approximately equal to the threshold value. To solve this disadvantage, the proposed algorithm improves performance by using Mahalanobis distance discriminant analysis for channel taps. This approach can mitigate the aliasing effect in the DFT-based channel estimator and reduce the leakage power efficiently when there is non-sample-spaced path delay. Simulation results show that the proposed channel estimators can eliminate the error floor substantially and its performance is better than the LS and conventional DFT estimators. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

We consider a network that may have power-limited sensor nodes and is used for target object classification. In the classification process, the absence, the presence, or the type of a target object is observed by the sensor nodes independently. Since the observations are noisy, and are thus unreliable, they are fused together as a reliable global decision in order to increase the overall classification probability. The global decision is performed at a remotely located fusion center, after combining the local observations. The combiner uses the best linear unbiased estimator in order to estimate the reflection coefficient of the present object accurately. By using the proposed system architecture, we are able to optimize the power allocation analytically in order to maximize the classification performance if the total power of the sensor network is limited. Two different cases of power constraints are discussed and compared with each other. The corresponding results are valid for additive white Gaussian channels as well as for frequency-flat slow-fading channels. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Low oscillator phase noise is crucial for good performance of nearly all communication systems. Probably the best way to measure the phase noise of an oscillator is the crossspectrum method. Basically, the phase noise of a device-under-test oscillator is measured using two identical measurement circuits synchronized by a phase-locked loop. Beside the theoretical background of the cross-spectrum approach and the discussion of the most common estimators, we present our practical realization of a cross-spectrum measurement setup for the determination of the power spectral density of an oscillator's phase noise at a carrier frequency of 16.384 MHz. A main focus during the design of the system is to achieve maximum measurement sensitivity. Here, the impact of the ADC noise floor on the system's sensitivity is identified to be the crucial aspect. Furthermore, we present an approach to measure the phase noise at frequencies very close to the carrier frequency where the result is severely disrupted by the error transfer function of the PLL in the measurement circuit. © 9th International ITG Conference on Systems, Commun. and Coding, SCC 2013.

	abstract = {Speech enhancement has an increasing demand in mobile communications and faces a great challenge in a real ambient noisy environment. This paper develops an effective spatial-frequency domain speech enhancement method with a single acoustic vector sensor (AVS) in conjunction with minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) spatial filtering and Wiener post-filtering (WPF) techniques. In remote speech applications, the MVDR spatial filtering is effective in suppressing the strong spatial interferences and the Wiener post-filtering is considered as a popular and powerful estimator to further suppress the residual noise if the power spectral density (PSD) of target speech can be estimated properly. With the favorable directional response of the AVS together with the trigonometric relations of the steering vectors, the closed-form estimation of the signal PSDs is derived and the frequency response of the optimal Wiener post-filter is determined accordingly. Extensive computer simulations and a real experiment in an anechoic chamber condition have been carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed method offers good ability to suppress the spatial interference while maintaining comparable log spectral deviation and perceptual evaluation of speech quality performance compared with the conventional methods with several objective measures. Moreover, a single AVS solution is particularly attractive for hands-free speech applications due to its compact size. © 2014 Zou et al.; licensee Springer.},

The approach employs, fuzzy logic to build the perceptual mask, embeds watermark in the low frequency coefficients for robustness with edge preservation and use neural network at the receiver. Novelty lies in providing copyright protection jointly to the low resolution and the super resolved images. The distortion due to watermark insertion is compensated by: 1. use of fuzzy perceptual mask tuned to human visual system; 2. use of trained neural network estimator during watermark extraction; 3. utilize image degradation model during watermark extraction.

By exploiting a periodic nature of channel transfer function, cyclic delay and pilot pattern with a maximum channel power are carefully chosen, which helps to enable a robust estimation of CFO and SFO against the frequency selectivity of the channel. As a performance measure, a closed-form expression for the achievable mean square error of the proposed scheme is derived and is verified through simulations using the parameters of the digital radio mondiale standard.

	abstract = {Background: Complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAE) acquired during atrial fibrillation (AF) are commonly assessed using the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), but this can lead to inaccuracy. In this study, spectral estimators derived by averaging the autocorrelation function at lags were compared to the DFT.Method: Bipolar CFAE of at least 16 s duration were obtained from pulmonary vein ostia and left atrial free wall sites (9 paroxysmal and 10 persistent AF patients). Power spectra were computed using the DFT and three other methods: 1. a novel spectral estimator based on signal averaging (NSE), 2. the NSE with harmonic removal (NSH), and 3. the autocorrelation function average at lags (AFA). Three spectral parameters were calculated: 1. the largest fundamental spectral peak, known as the dominant frequency (DF), 2. the DF amplitude (DA), and 3. the mean spectral profile (MP), which quantifies noise floor level. For each spectral estimator and parameter, the significance of the difference between paroxysmal and persistent AF was determined.Results: For all estimators, mean DA and mean DF values were higher in persistent AF, while the mean MP value was higher in paroxysmal AF. The differences in means between paroxysmals and persistents were highly significant for 3/3 NSE and NSH measurements and for 2/3 DFT and AFA measurements (p<0.001). For all estimators, the standard deviation in DA and MP values were higher in persistent AF, while the standard deviation in DF value was higher in paroxysmal AF. Differences in standard deviations between paroxysmals and persistents were highly significant in 2/3 NSE and NSH measurements, in 1/3 AFA measurements, and in 0/3 DFT measurements.Conclusions: Measurements made from all four spectral estimators were in agreement as to whether the means and standard deviations in three spectral parameters were greater in CFAEs acquired from paroxysmal or in persistent AF patients. Since the measurements were consistent, use of two or more of these estimators for power spectral analysis can be assistive to evaluate CFAE more objectively and accurately, which may lead to improved clinical outcome. Since the most significant differences overall were achieved using the NSE and NSH estimators, parameters measured from their spectra will likely be the most useful for detecting and discerning electrophysiologic differences in the AF substrate based upon frequency analysis of CFAE. © 2013 Ciaccio et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {Hydro-meteorological hazards like convective outbreaks leading to torrential rain and floods are among the most critical environmental issues world-wide. In that context weather radar observations have proven to be very useful in providing information on the spatial distribution of rainfall that can support early warning of floods. However, quantitative precipitation estimation by radar is subjected to many limitations and uncertainties. The use of dual-polarization at high frequency (i.e. X-band) has proven particularly useful for mitigating some of the limitation of operational systems, by exploiting the benefit of easiness to transport and deploy and the high spatial and temporal resolution achievable at small antenna sizes. New developments on X-band dual-polarization technology in recent years have received the interest of scientific and operational communities in these systems. New enterprises are focusing on the advancement of cost-efficient mini-radar network technology, based on high-frequency (mainly X-band) and low-power weather radar systems for weather monitoring and hydro-meteorological forecasting. Within the above context, the main objective of the HYDRORAD project was the development of an innovative \mbox{integrated} decision support tool for weather monitoring and hydro-meteorological applications. The integrated system tool is based on a polarimetric X-band mini-radar network which is the core of the decision support tool, a novel radar products generator and a hydro-meteorological forecast modelling system that ingests mini-radar rainfall products to forecast precipitation and floods. The radar products generator includes algorithms for attenuation correction, hydrometeor classification, a vertical profile reflectivity correction, a new polarimetric rainfall estimators developed for mini-radar observations, and short-term nowcasting of convective cells. The hydro-meteorological modelling system includes the Mesoscale Model 5 (MM5) and the Army Corps of Engineers Hydrologic Engineering Center hydrologic and hydraulic modelling chain. The characteristics of this tool make it ideal to support flood monitoring and forecasting within urban environment and small-scale basins. Preliminary results, carried out during a field campaign in Moldova, showed that the mini-radar based hydro-meteorological forecasting system can constitute a suitable solution for local flood warning and civil flood protection applications. © 2013 Author(s).},

	abstract = {Low oscillator phase noise is crucial for good performance of nearly all communication systems. Probably the best way to measure the phase noise of an oscillator is the crossspectrum method. Basically, the phase noise of a device-under-test oscillator is measured using two identical measurement circuits synchronized by a phase-locked loop. Beside the theoretical background of the cross-spectrum approach and the discussion of the most common estimators, we present our practical realization of a cross-spectrum measurement setup for the determination of the power spectral density of an oscillator's phase noise at a carrier frequency of 16.384 MHz. A main focus during the design of the system is to achieve maximum measurement sensitivity. Here, the impact of the ADC noise floor on the system's sensitivity is identified to be the crucial aspect. Furthermore, we present an approach to measure the phase noise at frequencies very close to the carrier frequency where the result is severely disrupted by the error transfer function of the PLL in the measurement circuit. © VDE VERLAG GMBH · Berlin · Offenbach.},

	abstract = {In this paper, discrete time higher integer order linear transfer function models have been identified first for a 500 MWe Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor (PHWR) which has highly nonlinear dynamical nature. Linear discrete time models of the nonlinear nuclear reactor have been identified around eight different operating points (power reduction or step-back conditions) with least square estimator (LSE) and its four variants. From the synthetic frequency domain data of these identified discrete time models, fractional order (FO) models with sampled continuous order distribution are identified for the nuclear reactor. This enables design of continuous order Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) like compensators in the complex w-plane for global power tracking at a wide range of operating conditions. Modeling of the PHWR is attempted with various levels of discrete commensurate-orders and the achievable accuracies are also elucidated along with the hidden issues, regarding modeling and controller design. Credible simulation studies are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed reactor modeling and power level controller design. The controller pushes the reactor poles in higher Riemann sheets and thus makes the closed loop system hyper-damped which ensures safer reactor operation at varying dc-gain while making the power tracking temporal response slightly sluggish; but ensuring greater safety margin. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {We present an optimization-based state estimation method that allows us to estimate the states of individual thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs), such as air conditioners and space heaters, from measurements of the power consumption of small aggregations of TCLs. The state estimator can be used together with a controller to provide ancillary services to power systems such as frequency control. The main advantage of this method is that it is designed to work with existing communication infrastructure. We assume that aggregate power measurements are available from distribution substations every few seconds, while TCL state measurements are available from smart meters only every 20 minutes. We model TCLs as hybrid systems and propose a moving horizon state estimator (MHSE), which is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program. We demonstrate the performance of the MHSE in two case studies: (a) estimation of TCL states in the absence of external control actions, and (b) a power tracking problem with closed-loop control using broadcast control inputs. To demonstrate the robustness of the method, we conduct a parametric analysis with respect to aggregation size and diversity, process noise characteristics, and control trajectory characteristics. The results show that the method generally provides accurate estimates of TCL states, resulting in improved controller performance in most cases, and is implementable in real-time with reasonable computational power. © 2014 American Automatic Control Council.},

The problem of the introduced 'hybrid' estimator is a proper transition between the EKF and the hf injection strategy. The transition is based on calculating of probabilities for each particular estimation algorithm. We proposed two strategies for proper algorithm selection. The first one is with constant prior probability of particular algorithms and the second one has variable prior probabilities.

	abstract = {This paper deals with microsatellite attitude determination systems which are a combination of a main estimator with high-power, high-precision sensors for higher accuracy estimation and a redundant estimator with low-power, lower-precision sensors for backup. Measurement data from all sensors in the redundant estimator are fused by the unscented Kalman filter to provide estimated attitude and the gyro bias values. Besides the accuracy of attitude sensors, the accuracy of this estimator depends largely on the selection of the process and measurement noise covariance matrices. In this paper, a novel real-time tuning unscented Kalman filter for redundant attitude estimator is introduced to tune these matrices efficiently in each filter step. The tuning process uses the estimated attitude of the main estimator as an independent truth reference data to calculate the cost function which is minimized by a downhill simplex algorithm. In the scheme developed in this paper a fine-tuning process is used, which results in faster convergence speed and higher estimated accuracy of the redundant estimator. Another important feature of the developed filter is that a flexibly estimated accuracy and system power consumption can be archived by choosing the duration and repeat frequency of turn-on time of the main estimator. © 2013 The Japan Society for Aeronautical and Space Sciences.},

CW-DA-ML CE is put in perspective with respect to two fundamental estimators in the literature: (i) differential frequency estimator followed by block $M$th power phase estimator (DiffFE-$M$th CE), and (ii) fast Fourier transform based frequency estimator followed by block $M$th power phase estimator (FFTbE-$M$ th CE), in terms of laser linewidth tolerance, frequency estimation range and speed, SNR threshold, and cycle slip probability. CW-DA-ML CE is 2.5 and 10.5 times faster than DiffFE-$M$ th CE in 4 phase-shift keying and 16 quadrature amplitude modulation signals, respectively, at a 1-dB system penalty for a bit-error rate of $10-3. Our CE has lower cycle slip probability and transmission overhead than DiffFE-$M$th and FFTbE-$M$th CE. Hence, our CE is shown to be favourable in pilot-assisted (PA) systems. A PA CW-DA-ML CE is introduced and shown to be robust against time-varying frequency offset with minimal training overhead. Analog-to-digital convertor quantization error on our CE performance is also addressed. © 1983-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Effective operation of cognitive radios (CRs) requires sensing the spectrum and dynamic adaptation of the available resources according to the sensed information. Although sensing and resource allocation are coupled, most existing designs optimize each of the tasks separately. This work optimizes them jointly for an underlay CR paradigm. The formulation considers that secondary users adapt their power and rate based on the available imperfect channel state information, while taking into account the cost associated with acquiring such an information. The objective of the optimization is twofold: maximize the (sum-rate) performance of the CR and protect the primary users through an average interference constraint. Designing the sensing in our underlay paradigm amounts to decide what channel/frequency slots are sensed at every time instant. Partial observability of the channel state (due to noisy and outdated information) calls for (Bayesian) sequential estimators to keep track of the interference channel gains, as well as for dynamic programming tools to design the optimal schemes. Together with the optimal schemes, a simple approximate solution is also developed. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Recently, multiphase machine is promoted to replace three-phase drives in high power safety-critical applications. Among the numerous advantages of multiphase induction machine drives, operation and self-starting under some phases open stand as the most important feature of such drives. With some phases open, optimal current control is proved viable to provide disturbance-free operation with some objective functions and under some operational constraints. Although hysteresis current control was simply employed in the literature with conventional field orientation to control the currents of healthy phases, it is not suitable for high power applications as it usually corresponds to high switching frequency and is susceptible to noise. Alternatively, synchronous reference frame (dq) control is much suitable; however, it requires back and forth transformations with several trigonometric calculations and additional sophistication to the controller with a corresponding intricate tuning process. In this paper, a simple controller using only two PR controllers for each sequence plane, with a total of four PR controllers for five-phase system, is presented. Moreover, a sensorless operation is also provided by estimating machine speed using rotor flux based MRAS speed estimator. The proposed controller is experimentally verified using a prototype 1.5Hp five-phase induction machine. © 2013 IEEE.},

The control method is used a modified Direct Torque Control scheme with constant inverter switching frequency using Space Vector Modulation (SVPWM). The variation of stator resistance due to changes in temperature or frequency deteriorates the performance of DTC-SVM controller by introducing errors in the estimated flux linkage and the electromagnetic torque. As a result, this approach will not be suitable for high power drives such as those used in tractions, as they require good torque control performance at considerably lower frequency. A novel stator resistance estimator is proposed. The estimation method is implemented using the Extended Kalman Filter. Finally, extensive simulation results are presented to validate the proposed technique. The system is tested to change in value of the stator resistance and a very satisfactory efficiency was obtained.},

	abstract = {Due to the fact that more and more electronic devices are widely employed in modern power systems, multiple frequency interharmonics may be stimulated and it will impose serious impact on equipment safety. The interharmonic phasor estimator based on frequency-domain model was proposed to improve the accuracy of the interharmonics estimate. Firstly, the interharmonic model was established with Taylor series, which was adopted to express the characteristic of frequency deviation. Secondly, multiple phasor estimates were provided by the Zero-Padding Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) against different frequency bins. The maximum bin and its adjacent ones were applied to reassign the interharmonic measurement estimated by DFT. The ideal interharmonic signals with/without various harmonic and noise were used to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm. The simulation results allow us to make a conclusion that, compared with the conventional DFT algorithm, the proposed algorithm can eliminate or reduce the measurement error caused by the frequency offset and limit the oscillation of the phasor estimate.},

An estimation algorithm that can rapidly track the fast-changing frequency and phase by using quarter cycle samples are proposed. Specifically, the data model in the three-phase power system is first converted to the noise-corrupted single phase harmonic signal model by using the Clarke transformation. A new weighted least squares (WLS) parameter estimator, which refines the initial estimates from the standard estimation techniques, is computed by utilizing the harmonic structure of the signal. Since the initial estimates become unreliable with limited samples, we proposed an iterative algorithm to polish the initial estimates for WLS. Numerical results show that the proposed estimator outperforms the conventional estimators, especially in a data-limited case. © 2013 IEEE.},

In addition, an alternative based on the Taylor series expansion technique is designed to avoid the exhaustive search.

Several passivity-based feedback designs are presented for the voltage-source converter, specifically for the H-bridge converter, since nowadays it is one of the preferred solutions to connect direct current (dc) loads or distributed sources to the alternating current (ac) grid. Independent of the operating mode, namely, the rectifier and regenerative operating mode, the achieved control aims are: high power factor correction in the ac-side and optimal dc voltage regulation capability in the dc-side. The proposed controllers can use series or parallel damping-based solutions for the error dynamics, naturally providing the conditions for stability and tuning of control parameters. In addition, the BM structure facilitates the addition of virtual resistance-inductance-capacitance (RLC) filter circuits to the control design for the rejection of low frequency harmonics. The effectiveness of series/parallel damping is investigated in case of abrupt changes in the load, using conductance estimators. Simulation and experimental results validate the analysis. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {A robust technique for online estimation of the fundamental frequency of both balanced and unbalanced three-phase power systems is proposed. This is achieved by introducing a widely linear least mean phase (WL-LMP) frequency estimator, based on Clarke's transformation and widely linear complex domain modelling. The proposed method makes use of the full second-order information within the complex-valued system voltage, making it possible to eliminate otherwise unavoidable oscillations in frequency estimation. In this way, the WL-LMP inherits the advantages of the phase-only approach, such as its high angle estimation accuracy and immunity to voltage and harmonics variations, while accounting for the noncircularity of Clarke's voltage in unbalanced conditions. Simulations over a range of unbalanced conditions, including those caused by voltage sags and higher order harmonics, and case studies for real-world unbalanced power systems support the analysis. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

State of the art systems exploit received signal strength (RSS) from WiFi devices, or ultra-wide bandwidth (UWB) timing based range estimation. RSS proved to be unreliable in rich multipath environments. UWB combats multipath at the cost of high bandwidth and specialized hardware which is not integrated in state of the art mobile radio transceivers, e.g., in mobile phones. We tackle this problem with round-trip delay (RTD) based range estimation with orthogonal frequency division multiplex (OFDM) modulated signals which are widely used in WiFi and 3GPP-LTE. In this paper, we present our measurement setup, specifically the developed prototype and two different indoor environments with varying multipath conditions. Measurements along ground truth points are collected for each environment and post-processed. We apply four different estimators, two based on cross-correlation and interpolation, and two based on Maximum-likelihood (ML) multipath estimation. Furthermore, we analyze differences for each estimator in each measurement environment. This analysis reveals that a simple correlation based estimator with interpolation and smart thresholding is sufficient and a very good trade-off between computational complexity and accuracy compared to ML multipath estimators. These indoor experiments show that our simple ranging technique is suitable for indoor distance estimation with low bandwidth, low transmit power, and can be exploited for LTE Direct with low complexity. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {A common simplification in the statistical treatment of linear time-varying (LTV) wireless channels is the approximation of the channel as a stationary random process inside certain time-frequency regions. We develop a methodology for the determination of local quasi-stationarity (LQS) regions, i.e., local regions in which a channel can be treated as stationary. Contrary to previous results relying on, to some extent, heuristic measures and thresholds, we consider a finite-length Wiener filter as realistic channel estimator and relate the size of LQS regions in time to the degradation of the mean square error (MSE) of the estimate due to outdated and thus mismatched channel statistics. We show that for certain power spectral densities (PSDs) of the channel a simplified but approximate evaluation of the matched MSE based on the assumption of an infinite filtering length yields a lower bound on the actual matched MSE. Moreover, for such PSDs, the actual MSE degradation is upper-bounded and the size of the actual LQS regions is lower-bounded by the approximate evaluation. Using channel measurements, we compare the evolution of the LQS regions based on the actual and the approximate MSE; they show strong similarities. © 2012 IEEE.},

Therefore, a reliable system should effectively detect and monitor a transient disturbance. In this paper, the transient detection problem is formulated as a binary hypothesis test: normal signal (null) vs. transient (alternative). The sampled data is described by a sinusoid under the null hypothesis, while a sum of damped sinusoids is utilized to model the alternative one. As no prior knowledge is imposed on complex amplitudes, frequencies, or damping factors in signal modeling, the general likelihood ratio test (GLRT) is employed to fulfill the task. To reduce computational complexity, the maximum likelihood estimator is replaced by ESPRIT for parameter estimation. Probability of detection of 0.98 is achieved at a SNR of 27dB and probability of false alarm of 0.0005. © 2013 IEEE.},

The existing power grid model does not provide real-time information of transmission devices, security during emergency events, and frequency and voltage control. The proposed scheme consists of location-centric hybrid system architecture for the coordinated processing among proximate devices. The neighboring devices follow a collaboration algorithm to handle faulty and incomplete information. The proposed scheme also consists of distributed algorithm for the maintenance of the local state of the smart grid and a real-time accessibility control of transmission devices. The security of the system can be guaranteed by reconfiguration through power-electronics and switches. An embedded intelligence is inserted into the power-electronics to facilitate the reconfiguration of the system, and thereby ensuring security. A generalized optimization formulation determines the optimum location of the transmission devices. In this paper, Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to handle the reactive power management. The use of GA decreases execution time of resource scheduling. This method performs better than the existing power grid models in terms of fault detection, degree of power saving due to power optimization, memory usage, consumer-GW (gateway) communication overhead, consumer computational overhead, and critical time. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

It is shown that the LMMSE estimator significantly outperforms the least square (LS) estimator in the low SNR regime and that the LMMSE estimator is less sensitive to the training sequences than the LS estimator. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to describe a new positioning technique to assist the blind and people with low vision to indicate their location and reach their destinations in both indoor and outdoor environments. The proposed technique is based on a combination of power attenuation and a received signal strength indicator (RSSI) using active radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology. The system uses a mobile reader with a power attenuation feature. RSSI is used as a quantized distance estimator for a short range and in combination with one of eight receiver attenuation level settings for a wider range of up to 70 m. A Global Positioning System (GPS) works efficiently in a similar environment but is only accurate to around 10-20 m and does not work efficiently in indoor environments. This research produced a system that identifies various locations such as offices, laboratories, theaters to assist users in reaching their destination of interest. It was then implemented in an indoor environment as an empirical case study to identify laboratories based on a combined technique with a successful identification rate of around 98%. The reader has eight attenuation settings, and the geographic range of each level using various tags was calculated. Then, to evaluate reliability, 6 experiments with 108 samples were conducted using three tags with distances from 1 m to 25 m, using power settings 1-6. A successful detection rate of 93.5% was achieved, as well as a false positive rate of 1%. Following this, the system was implemented in a park to evaluate its ability to indicate the position of the reader among a grid of tags in an open area. A satisfactory result was achieved. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {With the phasor measurement unit (PMU) networks that have been developed to improve utilities' wide-area situational awareness, it is now possible to obtain high-fidelity observations of forced oscillations (FOs). Due to the large variation in their amplitudes, reliable methods for detecting forced oscillations and estimating their parameters are needed. In this paper, an algorithm designed for the detection and estimation of sinusoids in white Gaussian noise is modified for the colored noise environment of power systems. A novel time-localization algorithm based on the cross-correlation estimator is proposed to estimate the start and end points of a forced oscillation, and an estimator for the forced oscillation's amplitude dependent on these location estimates is developed. Using a simple model, the algorithms are shown to be capable of detecting a forced oscillation, estimating its frequency, locating it within the data, and estimating its amplitude. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The appropriate speed control of induction motors especially at low speeds for rail transportation systems, lifting platforms with high power, electric motors and deep floating shafts, etc. is of particular importance. The vector control method using the two-phase and three-phase transformations and Clarke Park transformations is able to separate the components of the control components of flux and torque control of the motor. This separation makes the basis of vector control which we can apply control approaches on flux and torque individually like DC motors. In free mode sensor, an estimator is used to the speed of motor in the control process. At low speeds because of the frequency dependent parameters and the motor temperature in estimator equations, the accuracy in the in the rotor flux estimators comes down. In the reference frame status was dependent on the stator equations and the stator parameters are effective and in the rotating reference frame, the rotor time constant is a factor in the estimator. In this paper the performances of rotor flux estimators both stationary and rotating reference frames are compared for use at low speeds. The results of this study has been demonstrated the simulation results. These results suggest that using the idea on the rotor flux estimators in rotating reference frames, it is suitable for low speed applications. The idea is to correct the rotor constant time. Therefore, using an estimator, it can be expected to have a significant improvement in the torque dynamic response and rotor speed at low speeds. ©2013 IEEE.},

The presented algorithm uses the high time correlation property of the channel estimates to reduce the complexity and the power consumption by utilizing a lower number of bits for the FFT, compared to a traditional approach. The idea is that the channel estimator processes the the difference between channel estimates from two Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) symbols. The paper shows that the resulting HW could be reduced by 30 percent for logic and 15 percent for memory without performance loss in an Long Term Evolution (LTE) channel with up to 300Hz Doppler. The algorithm has been tested in realistic environments with 3GPP channel models. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Radio-frequency (RF) impairments, that exist intimately in wireless communications systems, can severely degrade the performance of traditional multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Although compensation schemes can cancel out part of these RF impairments, there still remains a certain amount of impairments. These residual impairments have fundamental impact on the MIMO system performance. However, most of the previous works have neglected this factor. In this paper, a training-based MIMO system with residual transmit RF impairments (RTRI) is considered. In particular, we derive a new channel estimator for the proposed model, and find that RTRI can create an irreducible estimation error floor. Moreover, we show that, in the presence of RTRI, the optimal training sequence length can be larger than the number of transmit antennas, especially in the low and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. An increase in the proposed approximated achievable rate is also observed by adopting the optimal training sequence length. When the training and data symbol powers are required to be equal, we demonstrate that, at high SNRs, systems with RTRI demand more training, whereas at low SNRs, such demands are nearly the same for all practical levels of RTRI. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {802.11-based wireless LANs (WLANs) have become an important communication infrastructure for today's pervasive computing applications. Nevertheless, WLAN users often experience various performance issues such as highly variable signal quality. To diagnose such transient service degradations and plan for future network upgrades, it is essential to closely monitor the performance of a WLAN and collect user statistics. This paper proposes a new WLAN performance monitoring approach motivated by the fact that many low-power wireless technologies such as ZigBee and Bluetooth co-exist with WLAN in the same open radio spectrum and are capable of sensing Received Signal Strength (RSS) of 802.11 transmissions. We have developed a ZigBee-based WLAN monitoring system called WizNet. Powered by batteries, ZigBee sensors of WizNet can be deployed in large quantities to monitor the spatial performance of a WLAN in long periods of time. By adopting digital signal processing techniques, WizNet automatically identifies 802.11 signals from ZigBee RSS measurements and associates them with wireless access points. To ensure the monitoring fidelity, WizNet accounts for the significant differences in ZigBee and WLAN radios, such as bandwidth and susceptibility to multipath and frequency-selective fading. A simple yet accurate linear estimator derived from a signal propagation model is used to infer the access points' signal to noise ratio (SNR). Moreover, WizNet can measure the congestion level of the channel and detect rogue APs. WizNet can also collect WLAN client statistics and classify device models based on RSS signatures of 802.11 access point scans. We have implemented WizNet in TinyOS 2.x and extensively evaluated its performance on a wireless testbed. Our results over a period of 140 hours show that WizNet can accurately capture the spatial and temporal performance variability of a large-scale production WLAN. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Three-dimensional time-resolved velocity field measurements are obtained using a high-speed tomographic Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) system on a fully developed flat plate turbulent boundary layer for the estimation of wall pressure fluctuations. The work focuses on the applicability of tomographic PIV to compute the coherence of pressure fluctuations, with attention to the estimation of the stream and spanwise coherence length. The latter is required for estimations of aeroacoustic noise radiation by boundary layers and trailing edge flows, but is also of interest for vibro-structural problems. The pressure field is obtained by solving the Poisson equation for incompressible flows, where the source terms are provided by time-resolved velocity field measurements. Measured 3D velocity data is compared to results obtained from planar PIV, and a Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) at similar Reynolds number. An improved method for the estimation of the material based on a least squares estimator of the velocity derivative along a particle trajectory is proposed and applied. Computed surface pressure fluctuations are further verified by means of simultaneous measurements by a pinhole microphone and compared to the DNS results and a semi-empirical model available from literature. The correlation coefficient for the reconstructed pressure time series with respect to pinhole microphone measurements attains approximately 0.5 for the band-pass filtered signal over the range of frequencies resolved by the velocity field measurements. Scaled power spectra of the pressure at a single point compare favorably to the DNS results and those available from literature. Finally, the coherence of surface pressure fluctuations and the resulting span- and streamwise coherence lengths are estimated and compared to semi-empirical models and DNS results. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new algorithm for harmonics estimation in power systems. Because of the nonlinearity of phases of sinusoids, the estimation of harmonic parameters is a nonlinear problem. However, nonlinear solving for amplitude estimation decreases speed of convergence. Thereby, hybrid methods decompose the harmonics estimation problem into two problems, linear for amplitude and nonlinear for phase. The objective of this paper is to introduce an accurate approach for harmonic parameters estimation. This approach is based on a stochastic search method, that is, clonal selection, to estimate the phases and a linear estimator, that is, least squares (LS), to estimate the amplitudes. This paper also indicates high accuracy of proposed algorithm in comparison with discrete Fourier transform and LS-Adaline (hybrid of LS and Adaline neural network) methods, especially in multiple frequency and highly noisy situations. Performance of the algorithm in noise rejecting even in interharmonics presence is shown by extracted simulation results of MATLAB (MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA, USA). © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, many industrial applications require online systems that combine several processing techniques in order to offer solutions to complex problems as the case of detection and classification of multiple faults in induction motors. In this work, a novel digital structure to implement the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) for processing nonstationary and nonlinear signals using the full spline-cubic function is presented; besides, it is combined with an adaptive linear network (ADALINE)-based frequency estimator and a feed forward neural network (FFNN)-based classifier to provide an intelligent methodology for the automatic diagnosis during the startup transient of motor faults such as: one and two broken rotor bars, bearing defects, and unbalance. Moreover, the overall methodology implementation into a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) allows an online and real-time operation, thanks to its parallelism and high-performance capabilities as a system-on-a-chip (SoC) solution. The detection and classification results show the effectiveness of the proposed fused techniques; besides, the high precision and minimum resource usage of the developed digital structures make them a suitable and low-cost solution for this and many other industrial applications. © 2014 David Camarena-Martinez et al.},

	abstract = {In numerous motor drive applications, high rotor speed is the key factor for system cost, performance, and overall energy efficiency. As a result of energy crises and global market competition, the specified rotor speed and fundamental frequency of the induction motor (IM) in many drive applications noticeably go up. For the same cost and efficiency reasons, that increase of inverter fundamental output frequency cannot be followed with the increase of pulsewidth modulation (PWM) frequency. Therefore, a very low ratio between the PWM and motor fundamental frequencies is to be expected in the near future. In this paper, the shaft-sensorless drive performance is investigated at high speeds, with a very low sampling to fundamental frequency ratio. As a result, two main problems with rotor flux estimators were discovered: the integration problem in the current-based rotor flux model and the phase error in the voltage-based rotor flux model. Both problems were addressed, and a proper joint solution is suggested. The effectiveness of the proposed solution is tested in a model-reference-adaptive-system-based high-speed shaft-sensorless IM drive. The experimental results collected from the digitally controlled IM drive with a low frequency ratio validate the proposed solution. © 1982-2012 IEEE.},

This method has lower peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) when compared to Asymmetrically-Clipped Optical OFDM (ACO-OFDM). It was shown that its receiver utilizes only 50% of the signal power, while the other 50% is discarded. A new receiving method, based on an estimator which utilizes the discarded portion of the signal, is proposed in this paper, to generate an improved estimator for the transmitted signal. It is shown both theoretically and numerically that the new approach improves the receiver performance of the system by up to 3dB, achieving the efficiency of the latest ACO-OFDM methods, while preserving the PAPR advantage. With this approach, both the transmitter and the modulated signal are not changed while the additional receiver computational complexity is negligible. © 2013 IEEE.},

Laser-linewidth and frequency-offset tolerances are studied. The filter length of a carrier estimator is shown to affect the cycle slip probability besides the bit-error rate (BER) performance. Considering that forward-error-correction codes are not robust to burst errors and phase slips, we demonstrate that filter-length optimization is necessary to avoid spectral-efficiency reduction in pilot assisted systems and potential system failures in differential encoding systems.

The IEEE Standard C37.118.1-2011 specifies test conditions as well as accuracy and response delay limits for different types of disturbances. In this paper, the performances of three state-of-the-art techniques based on phasor Taylor's series expansion specifically conceived to track phasors in dynamic conditions are analyzed and compared with the one-cycle discrete Fourier transform estimator under the effect of amplitude step changes, phase step changes, and linear frequency variations. Several simulation results show that the total vector error (TVE) tends to increase linearly with the step size. However, the peak TVE increments for a given step size are quite similar for all the considered techniques and are dominated by amplitude or phase errors, depending on whether the step affects the waveform amplitude or its phase, respectively. In this paper, the response times of the considered estimators for two different TVE thresholds are also analyzed and compared as a function of the step size, to assess their compliance to the requirements of the standard. Further simulation results show that in the case of linear frequency variations, responsiveness is not an issue and the TVE values of all estimators lie within the same worst case boundaries as those related to the case of static off-nominal frequency offsets. © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In the last years, waveform phasor measurements have become increasingly important for smart grid monitoring and control. While the Standard IEEE C37.118.1-2011 generally focuses on synchrophasor estimation accuracy expressed in terms of Total Vector Error (TVE), which comprises the joint effect of both angle and magnitude errors, the performances of phase measurement techniques alone are seldom analyzed. However, accurate phase data are expected to play a key role in future distribution systems (e.g., for state estimation). In this context, a thorough characterization of different algorithms for phase estimation only is of interest. In this paper, the performance of two frequency-domain algorithms, i.e. the basic DFT and the IpDP2FT phasor estimators, are analyzed from this perspective. Waveforms affected by various static or dynamic disturbances described in the Standards IEEE C37.118.1-2011 and EN 50160:2010 are considered. © 2014 IEEE.},

In the proposed wind energy conversion system (WECS), a variable-speed wind turbine, axial-type permanent magnet generator (PMG), Z-source inverter (ZSI) and sensorless maximum power point tracking (MPPT) controller are included. Although the conventional-type induction generator has the advantage of robust construction and maintenance-free operation, it has drawbacks like low-power factor and need for an ac excitation source which is overcome by the PMG. To obtain fixed voltage and frequency, PMG-generated voltage is fed to power converters. Conventionally the three stages of power conversion consist of rectifier, boost chopper and pulse-width-modulated inverter which reduce the efficiency, power quality and reliability of the overall WECS. To overcome these barriers of conventional system a two-stage-based direct-drive WECS is proposed. The maximum power point for each speed is traced using sensorless MPPT controller, which estimates the rotor speed, by using a simple sensorless speed estimator which is given as the input to the MPPT controller. The proposed sensorless MPPT controller for direct-drive WECS along with the ZSI is simulated in MATLAB/SIMULINK and the results are compared with experimental setup. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2013.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a new regularized transform domain normalized LMS (R-TDNLMS) algorithm and studies its mean and mean square convergence performances. The proposed algorithm extends the conventional TDNLMS algorithm by imposing a regularization term on the filter coefficients to reduce the variance of estimators due to the lacking of excitation in a certain frequency band or in the presence of modeling errors. Difference equations describing the mean and mean square convergence behaviors of this algorithm are derived so as to characterize its convergence condition and steady-state excess mean square error (MSE). It shows that regularization can help to reduce the MSE by trading slight bias for variance. Based on this analysis, a new formula to select the regularization parameter for white Gaussian inputs is proposed, which leads to a new variable regularized TDNLMS (VR-TDNLMS) algorithm. Computer simulations are conducted to examine the improved convergence performance, steady-state MSE and robustness to power-varying inputs of the proposed algorithm and verify the effectiveness of the theoretical analysis. Furthermore, the application of the proposed VR-TDNLMS algorithm to the design and implementation of acoustic system identification and active noise control (ANC) systems show that they considerably outperforms traditional TDNLMS algorithms at low excitation or in the presence of modeling errors. Moreover, the theoretical analysis provides simple design formulas for achieving a given excess MSE (EMSE) and step-size bound for stable operation. © 2006-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a low-complexity widely linear minimum mean-squared error (WLMMSE) estimator is proposed for a sampled improper-complex second-order cyclostationary (SOCS) random process. The conventional WLMMSE estimator that directly processes the sampled vector and its complex conjugate suffers from high computational complexity in matrix inversion and multiplication when the sample size is large. To overcome this shortcoming, the proposed estimator approximates the frequency-domain covariance and complementary covariance matrices by a block matrix with diagonal blocks and that with anti-diagonal blocks, respectively, which is motivated by the fact that both the two-dimensional (2-D) power spectral density (PSD) and the 2-D complementary PSD of an SOCS random process consist of equally spaced impulse fences. Moreover, unlike the conventional WLMMSE estimator, the proposed estimator processes the sampled vector and its complex conjugate after removing redundancies, which further reduces the complexity. It is shown that, for sufficiently large observation period, the redundancy-removing procedure results in a statistic that is approximately proper and sufficient. It is also shown that the proposed estimator is asymptotically optimal in the sense that the average mean-squared error converges to that of the WLMMSE estimator as the observation period tends to infinity. © 2013 IEEE.},

In this paper, instead of assuming a known APDP, we propose and investigate a joint estimator of the TOA and the APDP. We assume a multi-cluster parametric APDP model and estimate its parameters via a least-squares approach; the estimated APDP is then used in connection with a ML criterion to obtain the TOA estimate. The proposed method has a low sampling rate requirement and is well-suited for real-time implementation.

With its appealing dimensions, UWB communication comes with a set of challenges of which channel estimation is prominent. In this article, we explore the problem of channel estimation in ECMA-368-based multiband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MB-OFDM) UWB system affected by unknown narrowband interference (NBI). We analytically show that the unknown NBI causes larger variance of a channel estimator. Thus, MB-OFDM UWB systems are supposed to experience significant performance degradation. To reduce this effect, we follow a new preamble-based channel estimation approach, where the interference power on each subcarrier is treated as a nuisance parameter which is averaged out from the corresponding likelihood function. The later is then optimized in an iterative manner according to the quasi-Newton algorithm. Furthermore, we address highly-accurate channel estimation in a time-variant channel and propose an iterative interpolation method. Simulation results indicate that our proposed approaches provide more precise estimation performances than those offered by conventional channel estimation methods. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

Then, the support (positions) of impulsive noise can be found with the adaptive clipping threshold based on the CS estimation. Finally, the MMSE estimator is adopted to estimate the amplitude of impulsive noise based on the estimated support. The estimated impulsive noise will be cancelled from the received data.

	abstract = {In this paper the performances of the synchrophasor estimators provided by the Weighted Least Squares (WLS) algorithm based on the cosine windows are analyzed under steady-state, dynamic, and transient conditions. Two-, three-, and four-cycle observation interval lengths are considered. Specifically, steady-state accuracy is assessed by considering the effect of both off-nominal frequency offsets and harmonics. Conversely, dynamic conditions are modeled as sinusoidal amplitude and/or phase modulations, or linear frequency ramps. According to the IEEE Standard C37.118.1-2011 about synchrophasors for power systems, the Total Vector Error (TVE) is employed as accuracy parameter and the achieved results are compared with the maximum allowed values specified in the Standard for P- or M-class compliance. Finally, estimator response time to amplitude or phase steps is analyzed. The achieved results allow an overall assessment of the WLS synchrophasor estimator performances. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Digital approaches concerning the I/Q imbalance problem in zero-intermediate frequency (zero IF) mixing scheme have one of two main objectives: the first one is knowing the parameters of a widely - linear system (WLS) that models this problem with the purpose of devising a compensation scheme (calibration). The second one is estimating the system gain and phase imbalance values before and after calibrating the system to determine the quality of the manufacturing and calibrating processes (testing). State - of - the - art techniques for both objectives should involve three main aspects to be optimized: computational complexity, reliability and performance. In addition, a framework to use a single technique for both calibration and testing has not been proposed yet. This paper presents a low - complexity and statistically - efficient WLS parameters estimation technique based on the auto - correlation property of Golay complementary sequences (GCS). The proposed technique allows for disregarding the power amplifier (PA) nonlinearities affecting the model, making it reliable. In addition, a framework to extract the phase and gain imbalances in the I/Q branches from the WLS estimations is presented. The low complexity operations of the proposed estimator allow for a cheap hardware implementation. The performance of this technique is illustrated under extreme test cases. © 2002-2012 IEEE.},

Performance based on three different kinds of features is compared, i.e. for amplitude modulation spectrogram, Gabor filterbank-features and conventional Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), all of them known from automatic speech recognition (ASR). The evaluation is based on the office live recordings provided within the D-CASE challenge. The influence of the signal enhancement is investigated and the increase in recognition rate by the proposed features in comparison to MFCC-features is shown.

We derive the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for cooperative location estimators using the received signal strength (RSS) or the time of arrival (TOA) of the RF signal. Our derivations are based on a three-dimension human body model, an existing model for RSS propagation from implanted organs to the body surface and a new TOA ranging error model for the effects of non-homogeneity of the human body on TOA of the RF signals. Using models for RSS and TOA errors, we first calculate the 3D CRLB bounds for cooperative localization of the WCE in three major digestive organs in the path of GI tract: the stomach, the small intestine and the large intestine. Then we analyze the performance of localization techniques on a typical path inside the small intestine. Our analysis includes the effects of the number of external sensors, the external sensor array topology, number of WCEs used in cooperation and the random variations in the transmitted power from the capsule. © 2014 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Context. Galaxy clusters are the last and largest objects to form in the standard hierarchical structure formation scenario through merging of smaller systems. The substructure frequency in the past and present epoch provides excellent means for studying the underlying cosmological model. Aims. Using X-ray observations, we study the substructure frequency as a function of redshift by quantifying and comparing the fraction of dynamically young clusters at different redshifts up to z = 1.08. We are especially interested in possible biases due to the inconsistent data quality of the low-z and high-z samples. Methods. Two well-studied morphology estimators, power ratio P3 / P0 and center shift w, were used to quantify the dynamical state of 129 galaxy clusters, taking into account the different observational depth and noise levels of the observations. Results. Owing to the sensitivity of P3 / P0 to Poisson noise, it is essential to use datasets with similar photon statistics when studying the P3 / P0-z relation. We degraded the high-quality data of the low-redshift sample to the low data quality of the high-z observations and found a shallow positive slope that is, however, not significant, indicating a slightly larger fraction of dynamically young objects at higher redshift. The w-z relation shows no significant dependence on the data quality and gives a similar result. Conclusions. We find a similar trend for P3 / P0 and w, namely a very mild increase of the disturbed cluster fraction with increasing redshifts. Within the significance limits, our findings are also consistent with no evolution. © ESO, 2013.},

The choice of material and the design of motors are influenced by this knowledge. Prediction of system performance due to the effect of parametric variations of the system is the main reason to perform sensitivity analysis of physical systems. In this paper the effect of variation in parameters of induction motor (IM) like stator and rotor resistance, leakage inductance and mutual inductance on the performance variables like input and output power, power factor, efficiency, developed and starting torque, stator current, starting current and magnetizing current has been discussed in detail. A fourth order nonlinear polynomial for determining the slip of the IM is derived and solved using computational methods to estimate the slip of the IM at different load conditions. In addition the effect of variation in the supply voltage and frequency on the said performance variables are also studied and analysed under different loading conditions through mathematical and computational methods. Experimental validations of the effect of variation in stator and rotor resistance on the sensitivity functions are also presented.},

	abstract = {Channel quality parameters are needed to achieve efficient utilization of radio resources. These parameters include channel amplitude gain, channel frequency offset, channel random phase, channel multipath as well as channel noise variance. Usually, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the demodulator output is used as channel quality indicator to link bit error rate (BER). In applications such as power control, handoff, routing and adaptive transmission, SNR based channel quality is in practical success. Previous works are mainly for mobile or low speed vehicles, in the situation of slow varying channels. For airborne applications, wireless channel is highly dynamic. Block fading assumption may not be valid in this situation and channel parameters have to be estimated by a symbol by symbol fashion. In addition, incorporating convolution code may improve the system performance at the expense of more complexity. In this paper, we propose a channel quality estimation method to accurately indicate link BER. This method consists of two steps. The first step of the estimator is a channel amplitude gain and phase tracker. The second step of the estimator is a channel quality indicator based on signal distance between received signal and the maximum likelihood path along the decoder trellis. The distance measurements are generated by re-encoding the decoder output and comparing with the decoder input. A time-varying Wiener-Hopf equation is established in description of channel estimator, in which the solution is given by the correlation matrix of filter input and the cross correlation vector between filter input and desired response. A Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) estimate and a Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) estimate of receiver SNR given channel state information and signal distance measurements are derived. © 2014 IEEE.},

This means, that the machine will understand the two faults in the same way which makes the SRM faults detection and diagnosis a more challenging task. This paper presents a diagnosis method based on pattern recognition analysis to detect and to classify automatically the electrical faults, short-and open-circuit under any level of load of the studied system: redundant three-phase power converter fed 6/4 SRM. The phases making a pattern recognition diagnosis of SRM, the training and the decision. The training phase consists in determining the pattern vector and the optimal kernels design (the separating classes) by Time-Frequency Representation (TFR). The training data is carried out using a set of fault scenarios, between healthy, single and combined faults, in terms of torque measurement at different load level, in order to deduce the fault severity. The second phase, consists in associating an unknown pattern with one of the defined classes, according to the "k-nearest neighbors" (knn) decision rule, associated with Kalman estimator to tracking of various operating modes and to predict the evolution of the call out of the knowledge database for a given operating mode in order to realize a preventive maintenance.

	abstract = {Prony's method can be used as a dynamic phasor estimator. It can be regarded as the adaptive approximation of its complex exponential signal model to the dynamic phasor of an oscillation over a finite time interval. Equipped with a closed signal model, it is possible to implement it in one cycle. In its first adaptive stage, it estimates the best damping and frequency for its signal model; and, in the second one, the best phasor over the considered time window. This paper compares the performance of Prony's method with that of the very well-known one-cycle Fourier filter. With a higher flexibility, due to its adaptive nature, Prony estimates improve the Fourier ones under oscillation conditions. The Fourier filter can be considered as a static subclass of the Prony filters. With its static signal model, it is unable to accurately follow oscillations when the frequency fluctuates. Additionally, the Prony filter, together with its phasor estimates, provides instantaneous estimates of damping and frequency, corresponding to the first derivative of amplitude and phase, which are very useful to assess the power system stability. Finally, by being implemented in one-cycle windows, and its good rejection of the dc or exponentially attenuated components, it can also be used in protection applications. © 2013 IEEE.},

In this paper, a digital-domain self-interference cancellation scheme for full-duplex orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems is proposed. The proposed scheme increases the amount of cancellable self-interference power by suppressing the effect of both transmitter and receiver oscillator phase noise. The proposed scheme consists of two main phases, an estimation phase and a cancellation phase. In the estimation phase, the minimum mean square error estimator is used to jointly estimate the transmitter and receiver phase noise associated with the incoming self-interference signal. In the cancellation phase, the estimated phase noise is used to suppress the intercarrier interference caused by the phase noise associated with the incoming self-interference signal. The performance of the proposed scheme is numerically investigated under different operating conditions. It is demonstrated that the proposed scheme could achieve up to 9dB more self-interference cancellation than the existing digital-domain cancellation schemes that ignore the intercarrier interference suppression. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate low-variance multitaper spectrum estimation methods to compute the mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) features for robust speech and speaker recognition systems. In speech and speaker recognition, MFCC features are usually computed from a single-tapered (e.g., Hamming window) direct spectrum estimate, that is, the squared magnitude of the Fourier transform of the observed signal. Compared with the periodogram, a power spectrum estimate that uses a smooth window function, such as Hamming window, can reduce spectral leakage. Windowing may help to reduce spectral bias, but variance often remains high. A multitaper spectrum estimation method that uses well-selected tapers can gain from the bias-variance trade-off, giving an estimate that has small bias compared with a single-taper spectrum estimate but substantially lower variance. Speech recognition and speaker verification experimental results on the AURORA-2 and AURORA-4 corpora and the NIST 2010 speaker recognition evaluation corpus (telephone as well as microphone speech), respectively, show that the multitaper methods perform better compared with the Hamming-windowed spectrum estimation method. In a speaker verification task, compared with the Hamming window technique, the sinusoidal weighted cepstrum estimator, multi-peak, and Thomson multitaper techniques provide a relative improvement of 20.25, 18.73, and 12.83 %, respectively, in equal error rate. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

In this paper, the accuracy of four recently proposed synchrophasor estimators is analyzed and compared with the well-known one-cycle discrete Fourier transform estimator under the effect of static frequency offsets, amplitude modulation, phase modulation, harmonic distortion, and wideband noise. Two of the considered techniques track the phasor variations through finite-difference equations that estimate the first- and second-order derivatives of the phasor itself. The other two methods are instead based on a least squares estimation of the coefficients of the phasor Taylor's series expansion. The analysis reported in this paper covers the main scenarios described in the Standard IEEE C37.118.1-2011. In particular, the influence of different signal parameters on the total vector error (TVE) values is quantified and used to determine the maximum TVE increments associated with distinct parameters and the corresponding upper bounds. © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a wideband (WB) to super-wideband audio bandwidth extension (BWE) method based on temporal smoothing cepstral coefficients (TSCC). A temporal relationship of audio signals is included into feature extraction in the bandwidth extension frontend to make the temporal evolution of the extended spectra smoother. In the bandwidth extension scheme, a Gammatone auditory filter bank is used to decompose the audio signal, and the energy of each frequency band is long-term smoothed using minima controlled recursive averaging (MCRA) in order to suppress transient components. The resulting ‘steady-state’ spectrum is processed by frequency weighting, and the temporal smoothing cepstral coefficients are obtained by means of the power-law loudness function and cepstral normalization. The extracted temporal smoothing cepstral coefficients are fed into a Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-based Bayesian estimator to estimate the high-frequency (HF) spectral envelope, while the fine structure is restored by spectral translation. Evaluation results show that the temporal smoothing cepstral coefficients exploit the temporal relationship of audio signals and provide higher mutual information between the low- and high-frequency parameters, without increasing the dimension of input vectors in the frontend of bandwidth extension systems. In addition, the proposed bandwidth extension method is applied into the G.729.1 wideband codec and outperforms the Mel frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC)-based method in terms of log spectral distortion (LSD), cosh measure, and differential log spectral distortion. Further, the proposed method improves the smoothness of the reconstructed spectrum over time and also gains a good performance in the subjective listening tests. © 2014, Liu and Bao; licensee Springer.},

	abstract = {In amplify and forward (AF) two way relay networks (TWRN), two sources are allowed to transmit simultaneously in the multiple access time slot. Signal misalignment at the relay occurs due to the inaccurate time slot synchronization and different propagation delay. In broadband wireless communications, the misalignment could cover several symbol intervals. In orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based TWRN, such signal misalignment raises question on how to choose the fast Fourier transform (FFT) window at the relay node in order tominimize the interferencewhich will be forwarded to the sources. In this paper, the timing issue of the received superimposed signal at the relay for both sources in OFDM based AF-TWRN is investigated. The optimal timing that minimizes the total interference power at the relay is studied. The imperfect timing induced interference power at each timing point is derived. An efficient estimator is proposed for the relay to decide where to establish the FFT window boundary in order to introduce the minimum interference plus noise power based on the superimposed training block from the two source nodes. The estimator is a sliding window estimator measuring the total interference plus noise power at each timing position, and the timing position which minimizes the metric function is the optimal position to establish the FFT window. Finally, the performance of the proposed estimator is evaluated by computer simulation in the presence of different amount of signal misalignment. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013.},

	abstract = {The radio over fiber (RoF) distributed antenna system (DAS) has been chosen as one of the candidate technologies for next generation communication system. In RoF, the radio remote unit (RRU) utilizes orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) transmission, because of its increased data rate and its resilience to multipath fading. Also in optical fiber system, the optical components cannot be operated at high power, so their power needs to be reduced before inputting over the fiber. In OFDM transmission, it is necessary to estimate the channel to overcome the distortion caused by channel fading. The widely used channel estimation techniques are least square (LS) method and minimum mean square error (MMSE) method. However, they are preferred one over another for different scenarios. In this paper, we analyze and present modification in LS and MMSE method compromising between their complexity and performance for OFDM transmission in RoF distributed antenna system. We evaluate their performance through mean square error and bit error rate. We find that depending upon the estimator complexity, there can be considerable gain in signal to noise ratio (SNR) over the LS estimator. This considerable gain adds to the advantage of sending the signal with low power over the fiber before transmitting from RRU antenna. © 2013 IEEE.},

The harmonics generated in the power system by the harmonic injection buses need to be properly measured and quantified using minimal information about the power system network. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) provides several algorithms for harmonic state estimation, some of which are more accurate at specific harmonic frequencies. In this paper, the best ICA algorithm for steady state performance (i.e. the algorithm with the least error) is chosen and the resulting mixing matrix is processed by a Kalman Filter which functions as an optimal estimator. The harmonic state estimation is implemented on a simulated four bus system and a laboratory four bus model is also wired and the results of the work are presented. © 2012 De Gruyter.

	abstract = {Software beam synthesis by postset beam steering (PBS) technique is used to derive the horizontal wind velocities from multireceiver phased-array radar data. In order to improve the efficiency of beam synthesis, the Capon beamforming method is used to synthesize time series signals in the desired line-of-sight angle within the radar transmit beam volume (3.6° beamwidth). This paper describes beam synthesizing in optimum directions to reduce the error in the measurement of horizontal wind velocities using the PBS technique. For this purpose, beams are synthesized at various tilt angles with multibeam configuration. From the synthesized beam, power spectral distribution is obtained by one of the subspace methods, i.e., eigenvector (EV). The mean Doppler frequency and radial wind velocity at the desired line-of-sight angle are derived by an adaptive-moment estimation method from an EV-produced power spectrum. Using the moments obtained in various radial directions, horizontal wind components are derived by the conventional method for wind profiler radars. Also, an analysis is done for the required number of beams to improve PBS-based wind estimation. The statistical comparisons of performances of various tilt angles and beam configurations are being studied using the data collected from a multireceiver phased-array radar system (middle and upper atmosphere radar, Shigaraki, Japan). The analyzed results show that beam synthesis at the tilt angle from 1.5° to 2.0° using a 16-beam configuration minimize the error in horizontal wind estimation by PBS technique. © 2012 IEEE.},

Existing methods to recover these parameters in orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) are derived by following heuristic arguments and assuming perfect carrier frequency offset (CFO) synchronization. Hence, it is currently unknown how they compare with an optimum scheme performing joint maximum likelihood (ML) estimation of CFO, noise power and SNR. In the present work, the joint ML estimator of all these parameters is found by exploiting the repetitive structure of a training preamble composed of several identical parts. It turns out that CFO recovery is the first task that needs to be performed. After CFO compensation, the ML estimation of noise power and SNR reduces to a scheme that is available in the literature, but with a computational saving greater than 60% with respect to the original formulation. To assess the ultimate accuracy achievable by the ML scheme, novel expressions of the Cramer-Rao bound for the joint estimation of all unknown parameters are provided. © 2013 IEEE.},

This is achieved by using a novel class of widely linear complex valued Kalman filters, which provide unbiased frequency estimation and are faster converging and more robust to noise and harmonic artifacts than the existing methods. It is shown that the Clarke's transformed three-phase voltage is circular for balanced systems and noncircular for unbalanced ones, making the proposed widely linear estimation perfectly suited both to identify the fault and to provide accurate estimation in unbalanced conditions, critical issues where standard models typically fail. The analysis and simulations show that the proposed model outperforms the recently introduced widely linear stochastic gradient-based frequency estimators, based on the augmented complex least mean square. Comprehensive simulations on synthetic and real-world power system data, in both balanced and unbalanced conditions, support the approach. © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

If the estimates of the electromechanical modes are to be useful, knowing the variability in the estimates is critically important. This paper presents a method of directly estimating the variance of each mode estimate in addition to estimating the frequency and damping of each mode in an online setting using a recursive maximum likelihood (RML) estimator. The variance estimates are achieved using two closed-form multidimensional Taylor series approximations, the details of which are fully derived here. The proposed method is validated using a Monte Carlo simulation with a low order model of the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) power system under both ambient and probing conditions, with multiple modes closely spaced in frequency, and is compared to the regularized robust recursive least squares (R3LS) method. It is also successfully applied to phasor measurement unit (PMU) data collected from the actual WECC system, also under both ambient and probing conditions. © 1969-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Complex auditory features such as spectro-temporal receptive fields (STRFs) derived from the cortical auditory neurons appear to be advantageous in sound processing. However, their physiological and functional relevance is still unclear. To assess the utility of such feature processing for speech reception in noise, automatic speech recognition (ASR) performance using feature sets obtained from physiological and/or psychoacoustical data and models is compared to human performance. Time-frequency representations with a nonlinear compression are compared with standard features such as mel-scaled spectrograms. Both alternatives serve as an input to model estimators that infer spectro-temporal filters (and subsequent nonlinearity) from physiological measurements in auditory brain areas of zebra finches. Alternatively, a filter bank of 2-dimensional Gabor functions is employed, which covers a wide range of modulation frequencies in the time and frequency domain. The results indicate a clear increase in ASR robustness using complex features (modeled by Gabor functions), while the benefit from physiologically derived STRFs is limited. In all cases, the use of power-normalized spectral representations increases performance, indicating that substantial dynamic compression is advantageous for level-independent pattern recognition. The methods employed may help physiologists to look for more relevant STRFs and to better understand specific differences in estimated STRFs. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013.},

	abstract = {In DVB-T2 broadcasting applications, errors occur due to channel imperfections, reducing the system's throughput. The use of a channel estimator and equalizer counteracts the channel induced distortions and thus improves the system's Bit Error Rate (BER). In our study, a simple-to-implement channel estimator is proposed. It is based on averaging the sub-channel frequency responses of successive OFDM symbols in time, considering a very slow time-varying channel. In the frequency domain, spline interpolation is applied. The proposed estimator can be used in practical receivers with limited computation power and low memory capacity. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Offshore wind energy capitalizes on the higher and less turbulent wind speeds at sea. To enable deployment of wind turbines in deep-water locations, structures are being explored, where wind turbines are placed on a floating platform. This combined structure presents a new control problem, due to the partly unconstrained movement of the platform and ocean wave excitation. If this additional complexity is not dealt with properly, this may lead to a significant increase in the structural loads and, potentially, instability of the controlled system. In this paper, the wave excitation is investigated, and we show the influence that both wind speed, wave frequencies and misalignment between wind and waves have on the system dynamics. A new control model is derived that extends standard turbine models to include the hydrodynamics, additional platform degrees of freedom, the platform mooring system and tower side-side motion, including gyroscopic effects. The models support a model-based design that includes estimators for wind speed and wave frequency. The design is applied to a number of examples representing different wind and wave conditions and successfully demonstrates a reduction in the structural oscillations, while improving power performance. © 2013 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Current automotive electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) standards do not discuss the effect of the driving profile on real traffic vehicular radiated emissions. This paper describes a modeling methodology to evaluate the radiated electromagnetic emissions of electric motorcycles in terms of the driving profile signals such as the vehicle velocity remotely controlled by means of a CAN bus. A time domain EMI measurement system has been used to measure the temporal evolution of the radiated emissions in a semi-anechoic chamber. The CAN bus noise has been reduced by means of adaptive frequency domain cancellation techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that there is a temporal relationship between the motorcycle velocity and the radiated emission power in some specific frequency ranges. A Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural model has been developed to estimate the radiated emissions power in terms of the motorcycle velocity. Details of the training and testing of the developed neural estimator are described.},
