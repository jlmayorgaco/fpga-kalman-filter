	abstract = {This paper address the task of harmonic estimation of a power signal which is perturbed with Gaussian white noise. Along with the harmonic parameters, the fundamental frequency is also needs to be estimated which makes the estimation problem significantly nonlinear. Harmonic estimation problems often suffers from the incomplete knowledge of process noise covariance (Q). This paper investigates the estimation performance of two variants of Q-Adaptive Extended Kalman filter (QA-EKF) in simulation which have been rarely employed for harmonics estimation. Based on extensive simulation results the authors recommend a suitable variety of QA-EKF that demonstrates superior estimation performance over its competing estimation algorithms. ©2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Accurate local bus frequency is essential for power system frequency regulation provided by distributed energy sources, flexible loads, and among others. This paper proposes a robust frequency divider (RFD) for online bus frequency estimation. Our RFD is independent of the load models, and the knowledge of swing equation parameters, transmission line parameters, and local Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU) measurements at each generator terminal bus is sufficient. In addition, it is able to handle several types of data quality issues, such as measurement noise, gross measurement errors, cyberattacks, and measurement losses. Furthermore, the proposed RFD contains the decentralized estimation of local generator rotor speeds and the centralized bus frequency estimation, which resembles the structure of the decentralized/hierarchical control scheme. This enables RFD for very large-scale system applications. Specifically, we decouple each generator from the rest of the system by treating metered real power injection as inputs and the frequency measurements provided by PMU as outputs; then a robust unscented Kalman filter based dynamic state estimator is proposed for local generator rotor speed estimation; finally, these rotor speeds are transmitted to control center for bus frequency estimation. Numerical results carried out on the IEEE 39-bus and 145-bus systems demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. © 1969-2012 IEEE. 0885-8950 © 2017 IEEE.

	abstract = {Several controllers address Load Frequency Control (LFC) to minimize deviations in system frequency caused due to rapid disturbances in load demand and Renewable Energy Source (RES) penetration. However, large power systems' complexity and the significant frequency deviations observed often limit these controllers. In order to address these issues, a novel Cubature Kalman filter (CKF) and Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) based on combined state estimation and optimal control is proposed. LQR is an optimal controller that curbs the frequency deviations by calculating optimal feedback gain values. The CKF is a novel state estimator algorithm used to estimate the state variables by minimizing the error between actual and estimated states. The proposed control is tested on a small single-area power system and a large-scale power system based in Egypt. The results obtained are compared with the existing Extended Kalman filter (EKF) and LQR-based control, Virtual Synchronous Generator (VSG) based control, and conventional Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control with over and under frequency protection circuit (OUPFC). The efficacy of CKF-LQR is emphasized through the analysis of various simulation cases of the power system. The findings suggested that the proposed controller's performance was robust under frequency measurement noise, low inertia, sudden change in RES, and load switching. The outcome shows that the proposed control is robust and can effectively regulate the system frequency compared to the other controllers. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

The Aircraft Electrical Power System (AEPS) is very different than the residential and industrial power systems, in this systems, the frequency may vary between 360 Hz and 900 Hz, and the load dynamics is often modified. For aircraft purposes an enhanced filtering technique is required. The proposed AAPF topology is composed by an Asymmetrical Multilevel Inverter (AMI), controlled by the Conservative Power Theory (CPT) and synchronized by a Kalman Filter Phase-Locked Loop (KF-PLL).

A simulation study was conducted using Matlab/Simulink by introducing Gaussian and non-Gaussian noise in the measurements. Results under Gaussian noise showed similar accuracy performance for all filters. EKF and UKF presented convergence or numerical instability issues due to incorrect initial guesses of parameters. MHE did not present convergence issues, however, required comparatively higher computation time. Nonetheless, the MHE could still be implemented in real-time for state and parameter estimation of power system. The impact of non-Gaussian noise on the methods was inconclusive and will require further study.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Synchronized phasor and frequency measurements are key tools for the monitoring and management of modern power systems. Under dynamic conditions, it is vital to define algorithms that allow accurately measuring time-varying signals with short latencies and high reporting rates. A dynamic phasor model can help the design of these algorithms and, in particular, of those based on the Kalman filter approach. This article proposes a three-phase synchrophasor estimator based on the extended Kalman filter; state variables are obtained from Taylor expansions of amplitudes and phase angles. The underlying dynamic model considers the inherent relationship among the phases and includes harmonics in an effective way. The process noise covariance matrix that allows representing the uncertainty introduced by the dynamic model has been written by considering that practical ac power systems are nearly three-phase symmetric during typical operation. This a priori information allows improving noise rejection and increasing accuracy in the presence of amplitude modulation, as highlighted by the reported simulation results.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

This algorithm uses a Mamdani fuzzy logic to regulate the measurement noise covariance in the conventional unscented Kalman filter (UKF) algorithm. By doing so, a more accurate DSE can be achieved compared with the stand-alone UKF estimation method. In the BFAUKF, besides the disturbances in the measurement noise covariance, the covariance of the error in the state estimation is also applied to obtain a more accurate estimation. To show the effectiveness of this algorithm, a DSE design based on the proposed approach is developed for a load frequency control (LFC) in a two-area power grid. Four scenarios of noises impact the whole system in the process and the measurement spaces. The proposed method shows a significant improvement in the estimation of the dynamic states of the LFC model. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

An EKF-based algorithm is proposed to better adapt to the dynamic measurement requirements and to provide real-time tracking of the fundamental harmonic components and power system frequencies. This method is evaluated using dynamic compliance tests defined in the IEEE C37.118.1-2011 synchrophasor measurement standard, providing promising results in phasor and frequency estimation, compliant with the accuracy required in the case of off-nominal frequency, amplitude and phase angle modulations, frequency ramps, and step changes in magnitude and phase angle. An important additional feature of the method is its capability for real-time detection of transient disturbances in voltage or current waveforms using the residual of the filter, which enables flagging of the estimation for suitable processing. © 2018 by the authors.},

The proposed structure is formed of a multimodel base with eight models and an unscented Kalman filter estimator. This study is performed to allow the wind speed accurate estimation, improve the controller performance, maximise the delivered power and reduce its fluctuation. Furthermore, the proposed approach provides a power reserve to ensure the wind turbines' smooth participation in the network frequency regulation. This paper demonstrates, through a comparative study, that the unscented Kalman filter is an excellent alternative and gives better results than the Kalman filter and the extended Kalman filter in the case of highly nonlinear systems. The simulation results validated the proposed approach and showed its efficiency. They confirmed that the proposed controller, based on the unscented Kalman filter, can ensure the best results and the lowest fluctuation of the power than the controller based on the Kalman filter and the one without wind speed estimation. This allows the proposed approach to maximise the generated electric power and helps in the network frequency regulation.  © 2023 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

We present a co-simulation setup of a power system and a communication network simulator, where we demonstrate the networked control strategy in a realistic environment.

However, a variable wind power generation system when operating on its maximum capacity, is unable to contribute into the frequency regulation but it is capable to contribute during its deloaded operation. The amount of reserve active power for the frequency regulation depends upon the deloading factor associated with the control of wind power generation system. The service provider needs the this deloading factor and hence the active reserve power for the proper control of frequency. This paper investigates the estimation of the amount of deloading factor and thus active power reserve available with the wind power system which further can be used for the load scheduling and control. The estimation was made by the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) with only real power and speed of generator as measurements. The simulation has been done in MATLAB to observe the effectiveness of the proposed estimation.  © 2021 IEEE.},

Applications of the proposed nonstationary RLS algorithm to track the evolving dynamics of critical power system electromechanical modes in both, simulated and measured data, are presented.

	abstract = {Grid synchronization is a critical concern for proper control of the energy transferred between the Distributed Power Generation System (DPGS) and the utility grid. Nonlinear estimation techniques are proposed to track the voltage magnitude, phase angle, and frequency of the utility grid. Instead of directly analyzing in abc coordinate frame, the symmetrical component is employed to separate the positive, negative, and zero sequences in the transformed ab stationary coordinate frame. By using ab stationary coordinate frame, the number of system state variables is reduced to five. The results show that our proposed nonlinear estimation technique is efficient in smart power system synchronization. The MATLAB simulation studies have been conducted to compare the performance of Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), Particle Filter (PF), and Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). Computer simulations have shown that the efficacy of our proposed nonlinear estimation methods including the Extended Kalman Filter, Particle Filter, and Unscented Kalman Filter. It also shows that the Unscented Kalman Filter, and the Particle Filters are better estimators, because voltage synchronization problem is nonlinear system, and linearization process which the Extended Kalman Filter is based on is not very accurate. The number of particles in Particle Filter can be increased to improve the accuracy, but there exists a trade off between computational effort and estimation accuracy. In our research, with consideration the same computational complexity, we calculate the Mean Square Error (MSE) to examine the performances of different nonlinear estimation approaches. By comparing the MSE of different estimators, we prove that the Unscented Kalman Filter shows the most accurate performance in voltage synchronization for three phase unbalanced voltage. Our results have shown the potential applications in the future smart power grid synchronization. Copyright © 2015 by ASME.},

The main ideas are to use Kalman filtering algorithm to acquire fundamental component of load current and source voltage and to use the least squares method which is relatively simple and faster. The proposed robust Kalman filter-based UPQC system mitigated the issues such as voltage sag, voltage swell, harmonics distortions (voltage and current), and unbalanced supply voltage and power factor.

In this article, a cooperative control approach that contains load aggregators and individual loads was proposed. In this approach, the clusters of frequency friendly loads(FFLs) can respond to the variations of system frequency efficiently in real time. A frequency tracking control strategy was adopted in the decision-making programs of load aggregators, and a consensus protocol was designed for the interactions among FFLs. In addition, A Kalman filter was implemented in the programs of aggregators to keep their load members from acting too much or too often. At last, the feasibility of this cooperative control system was discussed, and verified via simulation. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a novel adaptive load frequency control (LFC) method based on model predictive control (MPC) using an unscented Kalman filter (UKF). The objective is to develop a robust LFC controller against the change in frequency characteristics of a power system. An adaptive MPC (AMPC) control is realized by updating the prediction model on-line to capture the frequency characteristics of a target system. A simplified prediction model is identified in the preliminary examination of the closed-loop performance of the target system, and then the system parameters are estimated in real-time circumstances. The estimated parameters include equivalent inertia of the target system. An interconnected three-area test system is used in the simulations to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The simulation results verify that the proposed MPC method can work successfully and efficiently handle the disturbances of the power system. The successful results also confirm that the proposed control scheme can be applied to a microgrid (MG) project, which is being promoted by the authors. © 2022},

	abstract = {Fundamental frequency is one of the most vital metrics of the power grid. Numerous frequency estimation techniques have been proposed, which are based on parameterization of deterministic signal models. Cautions should be taken since uncertainties such as noise are common in raw waveform measurements, and will propagate into estimation results. In order to mitigate the adverse impact of measurement noise, most recently, Kalman filter-based approaches were promoted, and are giving promising results. Nevertheless, conventional Kalman filter or extended Kalman filter have limited performance due to the high nonlinearity of the underlying state equations. In order to adapt to nonlinearity, this paper proposed a technique that leverages the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). The paper also introduces an approach that employs three-phase measurements to improve the overall frequency estimation accuracy. Simulation results show that the proposed UKF-based approach achieves extremely high fundamental frequency calculation accuracy despite severe noise interference. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The oscillation caused by subsynchronous control interaction pose serious threat to the large-scale grid interfaced wind farms. The magnitude and frequency of the oscillation vary with the variation of system operating conditions, such as the total number of online wind turbine generators, wind speed, wind turbine converter control structures and their parameters, degree of series compensation and strength of the AC grid. Such time-varying subsynchronous oscillation must be monitored to maintain the system's stability. However, the simultaneous tracking of time-varying fundamental and subsynchronous phasors is a challenging task. This paper explores the capability of extended Kalman filter for joint tracking of the time varying fundamental and subsynchronous frequency phasors. The proposed tracking algorithm is first verified on computer generated test signals, and then on a reduced simulation model reflecting an actual event system facing subsynchronous oscillation. The results show that extended Kalman filtering, with adaptive noise covariance matrix, can accurately and efficiently estimate the time-varying subsynchronous phasors. © 2019 Institution of Engineering and Technology.

All the frequency measurements available from PMUs can be exploited through the presented method to improve the estimation. In order to assess the benefits given by the integration of the frequency knowledge, the performance of the new approach is compared to different SE methodologies, by means of simulations carried out on the New England IEEE 39-bus system under different realistic operating conditions and measurement configurations.

The SSLKF provides a highly accurate and fast estimation of grid frequency and the fundamental components (FCs) of the input signals. The Kalman filter is designed using an optimized filtering technique and intrinsic adaptive bandwidth architecture, and is easily integrated into a multiple model system. Therefore, the Kalman state estimator is fast and simple. The fundamental positive sequence components (FPSCs) of the grid voltages in a UPQC system are estimated via these SSLKF-FLL based filters. The estimation of reference signals for a UPQC controller is based on these FPSCs. Therefore, both active filters of a UPQC can perform one and more functions towards improving power quality in a distribution network. In addition to the SSLKF-FLL based algorithm, a bat optimization algorithm (based on the echolocation phenomenon of bats) is implemented to estimate the value of the proportional integral (PI) controller gains. The bat algorithm has a tendency to automatically zoom into a region where a promising alternative solution occurs, preventing the solution from becoming trapped in a local minima. The complete three-phase UPQC is simulated in the Matlab/Simulink platform and the hardware is tested under various power quality problems.  © 2017 CMP.},

	abstract = {The characteristics of subsynchronous oscillation (SSO) in series-compensated wind power systems are significantly affected by the system's operating condition. Besides the variation in the magnitude and frequency of the SSO during an SSO event, the fundamental frequency may also deviate from its nominal value. This study aims at capturing the dynamics of both subsynchronous and fundamental frequency components simultaneously. This work first explores the strengths and weaknesses of various Kalman filtering based frequency tracking algorithms for joint tracking of the fundamental and SSO components. Then, it proposes a novel adaptive extended Kalman filtering (AEKF) algorithm, in which the process noise covariance is updated online by maximising the probability density function of the predicted error. The process noise covariance factor changes to positive non-zero value whenever the frequency of the fundamental component deviates. Thus, the proposed AEKF extracts the time-varying subsynchronous component while also tracking the small variations in the fundamental frequency. The tracking performance of the AEKF is validated on computer-generated test signals as well as on the electromagnetic transient simulation model of an actual wind power system facing SSO. The captured fundamental and subsynchronous dynamics can be used for designing monitoring, protection, and control schemes for the SSO. © John Wiley and Sons Inc. All rights reserved.},

The increasing penetration of renewable energy sources is leading to a smaller and more variable inertia, thereby compromising the frequency stability of modern grids. Therefore, a real-time estimation of the inertia would be beneficial for grid operators, as they would become more aware of the frequency stability of their grids. This paper focuses on an estimation method based on the extended Kalman filter. To be started, such method requires the knowledge of the time of disturbance, which, in turn, needs to be estimated.

	abstract = {Very short-term load forecasting predicts the loads in electric power system one hour into the future in 5-min steps in a moving window manner. To quantify forecasting accuracy in real-time, the prediction interval estimates should also be produced online. Effective predictions with good prediction intervals are important for resource dispatch and area generation control, and help power market participants make prudent decisions. We previously presented a two level wavelet neural network method based on back propagation without estimating prediction intervals. This paper extends the previous work by using hybrid Kalman filters to produce forecasting with prediction interval estimates online. Based on data analysis, a neural network trained by an extended Kalman filter is used for the low-low frequency component to capture the near-linear relationship between the input load component and the output measurement, while neural networks trained by unscented Kalman filters are used for low-high and high frequency components to capture their nonlinear relationships. The overall variance estimate is then derived and evaluated for prediction interval estimation. Testing results demonstrate the effectiveness of hybrid Kalman filters for capturing different features of load components, and the accuracy of the overall variance estimate derived based on a data set from ISO New England.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an improved estimation strategy for the rotor flux, the rotor speed and the frequency required in the control scheme of a standalone wind energy conversion system based on self-excited three-phase squirrel-cage induction generator with battery storage. At the generator side control, the rotor flux is estimated using an adaptive Kalman filter, and the rotor speed is estimated based on an artificial neural network. This estimation technique enhances the robustness against parametric variations and uncertainties due to the adaptation mechanisms. A vector control scheme is used at the load side converter for controlling the load voltage with respect to amplitude and frequency. The frequency is estimated by a Kalman filter method. The estimation schemes require only voltage and current measurements. A power management system is developed to operate the battery storage in the DC-microgrid based on the wind generation. The control strategy operates under variable wind speed and variable load. The control, estimation and power management schemes are built in the MATLAB/Simulink and RT-LAB platforms and experimentally validated using the OPAL-RT real-time digital controller and a DC-microgrid experimental setup. © 2020 by the authors.

The proposed controller has been designed to reduce the effect of uncertainties owing to variations in the parameters of governors and turbines as well as load disturbance. Each local area controller is designed independently, such that, stability of the overall closed-loop system is guaranteed. The CDM structure is built on the frequency response model of multi-area power system, and physical constraints of the governors and turbines are considered. Also, the standard Kalman filter technique has been employed to estimate the full states of the system including the area frequency deviation, these states has been employed by the (ECO) state feedback optimal controller to produce the optimal control signal. Digital simulations for three-area power systems are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. From the simulation results, it is shown that, considering the overall closed-loop system performance with the proposed CDM + ECO technique, robustness is demonstrated in the face of uncertainties due to governors, turbines parameters variation and loads disturbances. A performance comparison between the proposed controller, CDM alone, and a classical integral controller (I) scheme is carried out, confirming the superiority of the proposed CDM + ECO technique. © 2016, Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Frequency control based on wind power is required by the grid code for maintaining system inertia level as well as frequency stability. However, synchronous generator (SG)-emulated frequency control of wind power will result in a nadir and second dip of frequency trajectory after a disturbance, which may threaten system safety. Optimizing the frequency trajectory of system to improve the nadir and avoid second dip usually relies on grid-wide information. But the information is hardly perfectly acquired in advance for real power system since it may change anytime. To address these problems, an optimal frequency control method for wind power-integrated power system based on parameter identification is proposed. Frequency characteristics of wind power-integrated are firstly analyzed based on the common frequency theory. Then the control framework of proposed method to eliminate the nadir and second dip of frequency trajectory is introduced. To realize this framework, system equivalent parameters like inertia and damp coefficient are identified by the extended Kalman smoother algorithm after each disturbance. These parameters are furtherly utilized to shape the transfer function of wind power-integrated power system as a first-order system. Finally, the implementation steps of proposed method are presented. The effectiveness of proposed method is verified by case studies. © 2023 The Author(s)},

In the first step, the analog voltage or current signal obtained from an instrument transformer is statistically processed using interpolated discrete Fourier transform (IDFT) in order to obtain the means and variances of the signal parameters. These means and variances are then given as inputs to the second step, in which Kalman filtering (KF) is used to find the final RoCoF estimate. Accurate mathematical expressions for the means and variances of signal parameters have been derived and used in the second step, which is the main reason behind the superior performance of the method.

	abstract = {A new method based on a Kalman filter with a Least Squares (KLS) approach has been proposed to estimate the online power system frequency. This method estimates the frequency of the given signal based on three equidistant samples. In order to estimate the frequency, the least-squares procedure needs to be used, which results in successive triples of instances. The method is the best choice for estimating the frequency online because of its quick response and minimal processing demands. However, it requires pre-filtering the distorted signal before performing the filtering method. In this study, we first pre-filter with Kalman filtering and then use the LS method to estimate frequencies. Performance results demonstrate that the proposed KLS approach obtains a lower Mean Square Error (MSE) estimate when compared to the existing LS-based approach. The proposed KLS filtering technique is implemented in MATLAB.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With the development of computer technology, the concept of computer automatic control has gradually penetrated the research field of aircraft power control, and intelligent power control systems have become mainstream research. The present work aims to improve the performance of the broadband phase-locked loop (PLL) based on the linear Kalman filter. Specifically, this paper first introduces linear Kalman filter and second-order generalized integrator (SOGI). Then, SOGI is added to PLL based on the linear Kalman filter. The purpose is to use the infinite gain effect of SOGI at the central angular frequency to eliminate the time-varying angular frequency component in the error when the system inputs SOGI to achieve a better filtering effect. Then, the system’s stability analysis and parameter settings are carried out to establish an intelligent phase-locked method of aviation variable frequency power supply. Finally, simulation experiments are performed. The experimental results demonstrate that PLL via the linear Kalman filter with SOGI can solve the problem that the output phase angle contains high-frequency components when the power supply voltage distortion rate is 10%. This scheme has a strong anti-interference ability under power grid voltage imbalance. The accuracy of the Long and Short-term Memory network used here is about 80%, which can well realize the intelligent aviation power frequency conversion control method. The research reported here provides a reference for establishing smart phase-locked technology of aviation variable frequency power supply. Copyright: © 2022 Zeng et al.

Taking the interconnected power grid with wind power as the research object, the load frequency control strategy based on the wind power prediction by Kalman filter is proposed to reduce the influence in the system frequency caused by wind power. The Kalman filter algorithm is used to predict the wind power at first. Then, the forecasted wind power is employed for the load frequency controller design.

This is a challenge for grid-connected Microgrids whose frequency requires to be adequately monitored and maintained under operationally margins. Generally, in a power system, the strongest generators are the ones capable of maintaining the frequency of the system, however, when having distributed resources it is harder to keep such frequency between a secure threshold. Therefore, estimating frequency values in a short period of time becomes a helpful feature in this new structure of power systems. This work discusses the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) application for grid frequency estimation in AC connected microgrids by using a simple second order model. Furthermore, the EKF is used for forecasting the nadir according to the sample time variation. A microgrid benchmark is developed and tested under several load scenarios to test the frequency estimation process. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Traditional thermal power units are continuously replaced by renewable energies, of which fluctuations and intermittence impose pressure on the frequency stability of the power system. Electrolytic aluminum load (EAL) accounts for large amount of the local electric loads in some areas. The participation of EAL in local frequency control has huge application prospects. However, the controller design of EAL is difficult due to the measurement noise of the system frequency and the nonlinear dynamics of the EAL’s electric power consumption. Focusing on this problem, this paper proposes a control strategy for EAL to participate in the frequency control. For the controller design of the EAL system, the system frequency response model is established and the EAL transfer function model is developed based on the equivalent circuit of EAL. For the problem of load-side frequency measurement error, the frequency estimation method based on Kalman-filtering is designed. To improve the performance of EAL in the frequency control, a fuzzy EAL controller is designed. The testing examples show that the designed Kalman-filter has good performance in de-noising the measured frequency, and the designed fuzzy controller has better performance in stabilizing system frequency than traditional methods. © 2022, Tech Science Press.

	abstract = {The amplitude-frequency characteristics play an essential role in analyzing transmission power grids, such as harmonic amplification using the amplitude-frequency characteristics as the harmonic amplification factor, harmonic resonance, etc. However, when the cable line with distributed parameters is connected to powers, the model would be troublesome to be calculated for the amplitude-frequency characteristics by the existing methods. To fill this gap, we proposed a method of variable covariance probabilistic data association (PDA) Kalman filtering deconvolution. First, a typical high-voltage cable transmission system (HVCTS) and its dynamic model are established. Next, a square wave impulse excitation (SWIR) is injected into the system, and the square wave impulse response is extracted at the measurement ports. Then the variable covariance PDA Kalman filter (VCPDAKF) algorithm is proposed to denoise the noisy square wave impulse response. Meanwhile, the deconvolution method is used to obtain the amplitude-frequency characteristics based on the convolution model. Finally, it is verified through simulation and experiment that the VCPDAKF algorithm could effectively denoise the noisy square wave impulse response. The effectiveness of the proposed method for the amplitude-frequency characteristics is verified.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {As the wind power is random and strong, higher efforts have been incorporated into the load frequency (LF) controlling techniques. The research objective is we consider an interconnected power grid unit with a wind power system; the LF control approach has been developed based on the prediction of the wind by Kalman’s filter algorithm techniques which influence the change in system frequency due to wind, power. The Kalman’s filter algorithms are used for the prediction of wind power that has been generated in the starting and also the wind power forecasted for the purpose LF controller and designing. Further a LF control model interconnected in a power system network is been established. This adaptive control technique is been applied to a four-area interconnected distributed grid system with three thermal plant units integrated with a wind power unit. The simulation analysis is carried in MATLAB/Simulink which shows that the suggested LF control approach based on the Kalman’s filter algorithm with wind system prediction can beneficially reduce the occurred fluctuation in frequency and keep minimize the fluctuations in frequency. Simulation results are further compared with traditional proportional–integral–derivative controllers based on load frequency controller with a conventional wind system. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

In fact, Phasor Measurement Units are conceived as the key elements of advanced wide area monitoring systems. For these reasons, the design of measurement algorithms able to track amplitude, phase angle and frequency dynamics has been receiving increasing attention in the last years. The Kalman filter, together with a dynamic phasor model, is seen as a promising tool in this context. In this paper, a Taylor Extended Kalman filter formulation that considers the amplitude and phase angle Taylor expansion separately is introduced. A new dynamic model is defined to allow reducing the state space dimension while including also harmonics in a simple way. The performances of the algorithm in terms of both fundamental and harmonic components measurement accuracy are investigated by simulation, considering nonstandard tests inspired by the regulatory norms for distribution systems. © 2016 IEEE.},

This letter proposes a robust approach to identify power system center of inertia frequency with consideration of system uncertainties and synchrophasor measurement quality. A model decoupling strategy is first presented by taking measured generator active power as the swing equation input, whereas remaining the bus frequency as output. This allows deriving the linear discrete-time state-space form, which will be used by the robust Kalman filter for generator rotor speed, angle, and inertia estimation. The robust Kalman filter is mandatory as the measured frequency can change abruptly due to impulsive noise or system sudden changes.

Moreover, due to the lack of measurements in the electrical distribution system, the pseudo-measurements are needed to insure the observability of the state estimator. Therefore, the very short term load forecasting algorithm that insures the observability and provides reliable backup data in case of sensor malfunction or communication failure is proposed. The proposed very short term load forecasting is based on the wavelet recurrent neural network (WRNN). The historical data used to train the RNN are decomposed into low-frequency, low-high frequency and high frequency components. The neural networks are trained using an extended Kalman filter (EKF) for the low frequency component and using a square root cubature Kalman filter (SCKF) for both low-high frequency and high frequency components. To estimate the system states, state estimation algorithm based SCKF is used. The results demonstrate the theoretical and practical advantages of the proposed methodology. © 2019 IEEE.},

The model of each harmonic signal is easy and only two state variables are required, but if the harmonic model doesn't include all the harmonics in the measured signal, this will cause error in the estimated states by Kalman filter, in most of previous researches the Mean Square Error (MSE) was calculated to show how much the estimated signal is closed to the actual signal, but the MSE is not enough to determine the source of the error whether it is resulted from an error in the estimated signal frequency or its amplitude.

	abstract = {A new robust fusion Unscented Kalman filter (UKF) is proposed and applied to the problem of local bus frequency estimation in power systems. The presented UKF has two main features. Firstly, it fuses the local bus frequency data obtained from two different methods, i.e. SRF-PLLs and Frequency divider (FD) formula. Secondly, the detection and outweighing outliers in state estimation process is addressed using projection statistics. It is shown that the proposed robust fusion UKF (RFUKF) increases the reliability of local bus frequency estimation against data loss and cyber-attacks affecting one of data sources due to the fusion method. More importantly, it is robust against observation outliers. To verify the effectiveness of the presented method, the impact of the robust fusion state estimation method is studied on the bus frequency estimation for providing feedback signal to Wide Area Power System Stabilizer (WAPSS) which aims to damp the inter-area oscillation in power system. The results of the transient stability analysis are discussed through non-linear time domain simulations with PST toolbox. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we discuss the modeling and prediction of power frequency. Power frequency is one of the most essential parameters in the monitoring, control, and protection of power systems and electric equipments because when a significant disturbance occurs in a power system, the frequency varies in time and space. It is critical to employ a dependable model in order to optimize the efficiency and reliability of power systems in the Frequency Monitoring Network (FNET), and thus, prevent frequency oscillation in power grid. This paper describes the use of a state-space model and basis functions to predict power frequency. In the state-space method, expectation maximization (EM) and prediction error minimization (PEM) algorithms are used to dynamically estimate the model's parameters. In the basis functions method, we employ random basis functions to predict the frequency. The algorithms are easy to implement online, having both high precision and a short response time. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate that the proposed techniques are able to achieve good performance in frequency prediction. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The frequency of the grid voltage is a time-varying parameter caused by mismatches between power generation and power consumption. In fact, the fundamental frequency decreases when large loads are connected to the system or when a large generation source goes offline. The opposite holds true for an increase in the fundamental frequency, e.g. when generation exceeds consumption. Hence, in order to protect a power system against loss of synchronism, under-frequency relaying, and power system stabilisation, accurate frequency estimation is necessary. This study proposes an adaptive algorithm based on a master-slave unscented Kalman filter (UKF) configuration to estimate both the voltage frequency and the measurement noise. Specifically, the master UKF uses the strong tracking filter condition to improve tracking accuracy, speed of convergence, and to desensitise the filter from initial conditions. The slave UKF uses the master UKF innovation to estimate the measurement noise covariance. The proposed approach addresses the tracking weaknesses of other frequency estimation algorithms when the frequency of the grid voltage waveform changes abruptly. Algorithm performance is measured through computer simulation. © 2018, The Institution of Engineering and Technology.},

	abstract = {Automatic Generation Control (AGC) is a vital power system component responsible for the system frequency regulation. Also, it helps to minimize the tie-line power deviation in multi-area systems. The AGC uses communication to send/receive measurements/control actions about frequency and power deviation in power system. Small errors in AGC can drive the frequency out of the allowable range and blackouts may occur. Since communication links in recent smart grids are targets of cyber attackers, this renders AGC systems in modern smart grids susceptible to false data injection attacks. This paper investigates the impact of cyber attacks on the AGC and how the adversary can perform an attack against it. Also, it proposes a method to detect these attacks using a Kalman filter-based technique. To confirm the effectiveness of this approach, a 2-area power system is simulated using MATLAB/Simulink. The results show that the utilized technique is capable of detecting various types of false data injection attacks against AGC systems. © 2017 IEEE.},

This is achieved by using a novel class of widely linear complex valued Kalman filters, which provide unbiased frequency estimation and are faster converging and more robust to noise and harmonic artifacts than the existing methods. It is shown that the Clarke's transformed three-phase voltage is circular for balanced systems and noncircular for unbalanced ones, making the proposed widely linear estimation perfectly suited both to identify the fault and to provide accurate estimation in unbalanced conditions, critical issues where standard models typically fail. The analysis and simulations show that the proposed model outperforms the recently introduced widely linear stochastic gradient-based frequency estimators, based on the augmented complex least mean square.

This technique is based on a new approach modelling the PA behavior. The latter characterizes not only the PA non-linearities and memory effects but also its highly-varying behavior with carrier frequency in CR context. Given this modelling, a Kalman algorithm based post-distortion and detection is used to compensate the CR-PA non-linear effect and restore the input signal. This method is suitable for uplink communications in CR context because it saves the consumed power at the transmitter. Finally, this on-line technique does not require known test signals to estimate the PA model parameters. © 2015 IEEE.},

There are plans to install phasor measurements units (PMU) at almost all high voltage substations. The volume of data obtained from such systems is very large. While most of the time the power system is in ambient condition, however there are always several events per day occurring in the system. This paper presents a method to automatically detect such events from wide area frequency measurement data. The PMUs measure bus voltage frequency communicate them to a central location in real time at rate of one sample per power system cycle. These measurements are be fed to the auto event detection algorithm. The method of detection of event occurrence identification, event classification and exact instance of event occurrence identification is presented. The issues encountered in implementing such scheme is discussed in the paper. © 2014 IEEE.},

We present a state-space representation to model dynamical power systems like electrical distribution systems. The proposed model is able to take into account all the dynamic behavior of a multiphase power system. It has been applied to model a typical three-phase power system and its unbalance, i.e., an electrical grid which can be perturbed by nonlinear loads and distributed renewable energy generation which is a typical changing system. Associated with an extended Kalman filter, the state-space model is used to iteratively estimate power quality parameters. Indeed, the symmetrical components of the power system, i.e., their amplitude and phase angle values, and the fundamental frequency can be calculated at each iteration without any prior knowledge. The proposed estimation technique is an evolving and adaptive method able to handle the changing power system. Its effectiveness has been evaluated by several tests. Results have been compared to other methods. They show the efficiency and better performance of the proposed method. The fundamental frequency and the symmetrical components are precisely estimated even under disturbed and time-varying conditions. This state-space representation can therefore be used in active power filtering schemes and in load frequency control strategies. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Firstly, the Kalman filter is used to obtain the target grid-connected power and the total smoothing power control signal of the energy storage system. Then, considering the working characteristics of different energy storage media of Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS), Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is used to obtain each intrinsic mode component within the allowable range of charging and discharging frequency, and the Hilbert transform is used to obtain the main frequency of the energy storage power signal, so as to determine the filtering time constant and assign the high-frequency fluctuation to the super capacitor. The low frequency fluctuation is borne by the battery. Finally, the effectiveness and accuracy of the method are verified by simulation. The simulation results show that this method can effectively suppress the power fluctuation of wind farm, which is of great significance to improve the power quality of wind power integration and enhance the stability of power system.  © 2022 IEEE.},

The oscillation frequency depends on various factors including series compensation degree, wind speed, grid stiffness, converter control structures and parameters, and number of in-service wind generators. The accurate estimation of time-varying subsynchronous frequency component is necessary for the identification, monitoring, and control of the SSCI. In this work, Kalman filtering approach is utilized to recursively extract the time-varying subsynchronous frequency component. The proposed methodology is first verified on benchmark signals under fixed and time-varying subsynchronous components. Then, it is validated on an actual wind power system suffering from SSCI. The Kalman filter based frequency estimator is developed in PSCAD and run in parallel with the Guyuan wind power system model.

The critical information in this context is the input signals such as field voltage and mechanical torque which are not available from easily available terminal phasor measurement unit (PMU) signals. To overcome these issues, the Extended Kalman Filter with Unknown Inputs, referred to as the EKF-UI technique, is employed in this paper for decentralized dynamic state estimation of a synchronous machine states using terminal active and reactive powers, voltage phasor and frequency measurements. It is demonstrated that using the decentralized EKF-UI scheme, synchronous machine states can be estimated accurately enough to enable wide-area power system stabilizers (WA-PSSs).

	abstract = {Automatic Generation Control (AGC) is an important tool to ensure the stability and reliability of power systems. For stable operation of power systems, the frequency of the system should be reserved within the nominal value. Towards this, the estimation of states is of supreme implication. In this paper, a comparison is made on the estimation of the states using Kalman filter method and optimal control approach to the Automatic Generation Control (AGC) of an isolated power system. The performance of optimised Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) in pole placement is compared with Kalman filter estimating the states for pole placement. Genetic Algorithm is used to optimise the weighting matrices Q and R of an LQR controller. Kalman filter based controller estimates the states of the system by measuring only one output signal i.e. the frequency output of the system considered. The comparison is made on the basis of the mean of the variances of frequency estimate of both the approaches under different noise levels from independent Monte Carlo simulations.

However, the reconvergence ability of the FDKF was not comprehensively resolved and analyzed in the literature. This letter presents the steady-state solutions of the predicted system distance and corresponding step size of the FDKF, which is found to be related to the signal-to-noise ratio and the transition parameter. On this basis, it is pointed out that a frequently observed slow reconvergence of the FDKF, when the sudden echo-path change occurs, can be mainly attributed to the over-estimated noise power spectral density. Finally, we propose a shadow filter approach to resolve the algorithm's lack of reconvergence. Computer simulations of acoustic echo cancelation confirm the improved performance of the proposed method. © 1994-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The performance of power systems in restructured environments has become increasingly more complex due to the technical limitations and traditional requirements. To this end, electrical power systems act independently in the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity, leading to restructuring and deregulation. On the one hand, technical requirements for transmission lines and renewable energies will contribute to HVDC transmission. On the other hand, one of the main goals of the Automatic Generation Control (AGC) is to manage Load Frequency Control (LFC) in a multi-area power system. In order to examine the internal and intrinsic stability, the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) control method was used but since neither all the state variables were available nor their measurements were noise-free, the LQR controller was used with the Kalman filter (KF) for the real-time control for solving the LFC problem. Finally in the section on the simulation, a comparison was made using MATLAB, between two multi-area power systems consisting of thermal and hydroelectric generation units, one of which with the HVDC transmission lines and the other one without them, in terms of frequency stability. Moreover, the simulation results indicated that the introduced control method led to the improved LFC performance in a multi-area power system with HVDC transmission links. © 2018 Elsevier GmbH},

	abstract = {With power networks undergoing an unprecedented transition from traditional power systems to modern electric grids integrated with renewable energy sources, maintaining frequency stability of generators in modern power systems has become one of the major concerns. Targeting this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel frequency restoration strategy in photovoltaics (PV)-connected power systems using decentralized dynamic state estimation technique and PV power plant as a contingency power source. When a sudden increase in load demand occurs, the output power of PV panels is increased in order to compensate for the shortage of real power capacity of the generator, in order to restore the frequency of a certain generator bus bar. An unscented Kalman filter-based decentralized dynamic estimation is utilized in this study to estimate the frequency of a selected generator bus bar with local noisy voltage and current measurement data acquired by using phasor measurement units. Solar luminous intensity may vary over a period of time in different seasons, weather conditions, etc., which causes the variations in the output power of PV power plants. This irradiance uncertainty is also considered in this study. The proposed control strategy not only incorporates the frequency deviations of a generator bus-bar, but also takes into account the tie-line power deviations under disturbances. Simulation results demonstrate the capacity of proposed control schemes in restoring the frequency of generator bus-bars and also maintaining the tie-line power flowing between adjoining areas at it scheduled value. © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Measurement of time varying harmonics has assumed great importance for power quality estimation in micro and smart grid environments. It is well known that the power signals undergo dynamic transitions during power quality and fault type disturbances. Also accurate estimation of amplitude, phase and frequency of a sinusoid in the presence of harmonics/inter harmonics and noise plays an important role in wide variety of power system applications, like protection, power quality control and state monitoring. One of the widely used approach like the Fourier linear combiners become ineffective to track the sudden changes in the power harmonic amplitude and phase angles in the presence noise and distortions. This paper, therefore, presents a new adaptive robust Kalman filter (REKF) for estimating the fundamental and harmonic phasors and frequency in a distributed generation systems suitable for the detection of islanding, nonislanding and switching events. The REKF is based on linear H-infinity technique to avoid the error divergence due to linearization and Jacobian formulation in the usual extended Kalman filter (EKF). Further the noise covariance matrices of the robust Kalman filter are tuned iteratively to produce faster convergence and speed of accuracy in tracking time varying harmonic phasors. © 2015 IEEE.},

The voltage model and discrete complex phasor state space equation were established of three-phase four wire system, and proposes a master-slave Kalman filter was proposed to estimate the frequency and noise covariance of system voltage, so as to quickly track the frequency and amplitude of the grid voltage in the system with measurement noise and frequency offset; meanwhile, a load harmonic detection method based on adaptive neural network was proposed, which can accurately obtain the amplitude and phase of each harmonic component in the load current in a power frequency cycle. The results show that the method is superior to the traditional Kalman filter algorithm in frequency tracking time and accuracy.

	abstract = {In order to improve the energy capture efficiency of the wave energy converter, an optimal control scheme is proposed, which based on the double self-tuning second-order integrator (DSSOGI) frequency-locked loop and improved whale algorithm. Seeking the optimal load of the wave power system through the frequency domain response analysis of the hydrodynamic model, introducing the DSSOGI frequency-locked loop structure to measure the wave frequency in real time, the extended Kalman filter is used to estimate the wave main frequency, which can accelerate the dynamic response performance of structural frequency tracking of the frequency-locked loop. When the wave period changes, the wave frequency, the corresponding float speed and displacement after filtering is measured online by the above composite structure. The nonlinear hydrodynamic parameters are determined by using boundary element method software. Combining the improved whale optimization algorithm to find the optimal load of the system and controlling the linear power generation device, the capture efficiency is improved. The simulation results show that the proposed control scheme effectively improves the nonlinear problem of hydrodynamic parameters and increases the system output power. © 2021, Solar Energy Periodical Office Co., Ltd.

	abstract = {The control of an active power filter (APF) with LCL-filter is affected by variable inductance present in the power line of the grid. The variation of impedance will impacts the resonance frequency and system bandwidth. Therefore, the exact measurement of the grid impedance is necessary. Real-time estimation of the equivalent grid impedance by means of extended Kalman filter is addressed. The theoretical background of the extended Kalman filter used for equivalent grid impedance estimation is introduced. Using the estimated impedance and other known parameters to quantitative calculate the system cross over frequency and system resonant frequency caused by LCL-filter. Taking these limitations into account, this paper presents a reliable method to determine the maximum order of harmonic current need to be compensated. The overall system stability and harmonic compensation under different power grid conditions are guaranteed through this method. The theoretical analysis is verified on a 65kVA three-phase shunt APF. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Noise pollution, harmonics and deviation of frequency may cause problems during operation of appliances in the power system. Extended Kalman filter (EKF) which is appropriate for nonlinear state estimation has been implemented for the estimation of harmonics encountered in power system. EKF works based on the concept of linearization of nonlinear functions about the current mean and covariance so as to follow Kalman filter (KF) for linear signal models. EKF has been preferred here for harmonics estimation to estimate frequency along with the harmonics parameters in the presence of noise in a power signal. Eventually, the performance of the EKF-based approach is demonstrated by Monte Carlo simulation. Monte Carlo simulation demonstrates the consistency and convergence of EKF during harmonics estimation when the power signal is influenced by noise. Suitability of this approach is also illustrated with the help of real data taken into account. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

In this paper, the potentialities and the limits of an algorithm based on a Smoothed Taylor-Kalman Filter (ST-KF) are presented and explained. The proposed algorithm relies on a variant of the so-called Taylor-Kalman Filter (T-KF), but with a reduced computational complexity thanks to the expression of complex quantities in rectangular coordinates and an iterated implementation. In addition, an output smoother provides a better frequency estimation in offnominal conditions. Some simulation results show the benefits of the proposed approach in dynamic conditions, as well as the performance limitation of Taylor-Kalman Filter solutions when large harmonics and inter-harmonics are considered. © 2016 IEEE.},

One solution is the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) based feedback controller for LFC that computes the optimal feedback gain values from the known system parameters and state variables by minimizing a cost function. However, all the system parameters and state variables may not be available at all times, which restricts the use of the LQR controller. Therefore, the proposed estimation algorithm, i.e., the Extended Kalman filter (EKF), is utilized to estimate the state variables using a series of measurements over time. The simulation results produced using the EKF-LQR-based controller validate that the proposed scheme can efficiently regulate the system frequency and offer robust performance compared to Virtual Synchronous Generator-based (VSG) and conventional PID controllers.  © 2022 IEEE.},

This study proposes an online method based on the transient behavior of individual appliances as well as system steady-state characteristics to estimate the operating states of the appliances. It determines the number of states for each appliance using the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) method and models the transition relationship among different states. The states of the working appliances are identified from aggregated power signals using the Kalman filtering method in the factorial hidden Markov model (FHMM). Thereafter, the identified states are confirmed by the verification of system states, which are the combination of the working states of individual appliances. The verification step involves comparing the total measured power consumption with the total estimated power consumption. The use of transient features can achieve fast state inference and it is suitable for online load disaggregation.

	abstract = {This paper presents a new Extended Kalman filter-based method for the estimation of the rotor angular speed of a synchronous machine. The main utility of the estimated speed is in the power system stabilizer. The paper briefly reviews the problems associated with the existing methods for reliable and accurate rotor speed measurement or estimation. It is shown that the existing methods of rotor speed estimation have some severe drawbacks and may cause the power system stabilizer to operate suboptimal or even produce negative damping over a specific frequency range when an inaccurate rotor speed signal is used as the input to the power system stabilizer. Most importantly it demonstrates that a system equipped with it behaves as predicted in simulations, especially when examining inter-area modes. The new rotor speed estimation method was implemented on an industrial control platform and integrated in a modern digital excitation system. A series of hardware-in-the-loop simulations were run to examine the properties of the new speed estimator. The simulations confirm that the new speed offers superior performance in terms of speed estimation accuracy, which allows the proper damping of oscillations over a frequency range of interest. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The load frequency control (LFC) system, a critical component maintaining frequency stability in the smart grid, is vulnerable to invisible false data injection attacks (FDIAs). These FDIAs can get behind the bad data detection (BDD) system and cause significant damage to the smart grid. Firstly, This paper proposes a detection and defense model against unobservable FDIAs in the LFC system based on the combination of the attack-detection evolutionary game (AEG) model and Kalman filtering (KF) algorithm. Then, Support vector machines (SVM) and K-Nearest neighbor (KNN) are two detection algorithms of the AEG model that are trained by gathering historical data of frequency deviation, tie-line power deviation, and active power load deviation in the smart grid responding to two different forms of FDIAs. The optimal detection algorithm is provided by analyzing the evolution of the equilibrium point of the game. Finally, a mitigation method based on the KF algorithm is proposed, in which the optimal control signal is estimated and issued to the LFC system in order to restore the system frequency stability. Simulation results on a two-area interconnected power system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed detection and defense strategies.  © 2013 IEEE.},

The major challenge of the synchronization is how to quickly and precisely extract the ac signal and fundamental positive sequence in single-and three-phase power systems, respectively. This paper proposes a new detection technique based on a modified Kalman filter and the generalized averaging method. The method has an open-loop structure, and uses the orthogonal signals which are obtained directly from the Kalman filter. The resulted detection system is very simple and robust even in the presence of power quality disturbances, such as voltage imbalance, harmonics, and voltage fluctuations. The proposed technique can detect the fundamental and harmonics frequencies within or less than half a cycle in all situations, such as small and considerable frequency variations. Meanwhile, the method guarantees the zero steady-state error in complicated harmonic scenarios, including all typical single-phase and three-phase harmonics. Various case studies are assessed and the performance of the proposed detection method is verified by experiments. © 1986-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The present work explores the power quality problems of a microgrid in the aviation field, such as frequency offset or waveform distortion, caused by voltage imbalance and nonlinear load, to ensure the efficient and stable flight of aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles, and other aircraft. There are many problems such as excessive harmonics, voltage imbalance, and direct current (DC) component in aviation variable frequency power supply voltage in microgrid under different conditions. Therefore, three kinds of second-order generalized integrators (SOGIs) with different structures are combined with linear Kalman filter phase-locked loops (PLLs). Besides, intelligent sensors are utilized for signal processing. Finally, simulation experiments are conducted to compare three SOGIs. The results show that the system is stable when the parameters k1 = 738.9553, k2 = 1092108.98405, k3 = 1477.91, and Ts = 0.000125 s and k ranges in [0.5, 3]. The angular frequency of PLL output is very low under the problems of many harmonics, three-phase voltage imbalance, and DC component ωg. The angular frequency ωg output by the PLL finally changes linearly with a change rate of 400 πrad/s2, so that the output phase angle θg reaches a stable state. Thus, the proposed steady-state linear Kalman filter phase locking can accurately phase-lock the aviation variable frequency power supply. It provides an important reference for the power supply module in the microgrid to select the appropriate second-order generalized integrator to realize the accurate phase locking of the phase-locked loop under different conditions.  © 2022 Hindawi Limited.

	abstract = {This paper proposes a new robust method for accurately and reliably estimating remote bus frequencies in a power system. Two different measurement sources for the remote bus frequency are considered, that is, the ideal Frequency Divider (FD) and the Synchronous Reference Frame Phase Locked Loops (SRF-PLLs). Each measurement signal encounters different uncertainties and data quality issues. In this paper, both data sources are employed and fused together to better estimate the remote bus frequencies. To this end, the model structure of the power system is selected and an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) is utilized together with a fusion covariance intersection method to enhance the accuracy of the estimated bus frequency. Since the fusion estimation method fails in case of quality issues on both channels, a robust Generalized Maximum-likelihood UKF (GM-UKF) using a novel outlier detection criteria is developed. The impact of the resulting robust fusion filter on the estimation of the remote bus frequencies and on the performance of WAPSS, which makes use of the estimated frequencies as the feedback signal, is examined via simulations. The results demonstrate the excellent performance and reliability of the proposed method in dealing with noise filtering and outlier suppression while ensuring a high statistical efficiency. © 2023 The Authors.

As a case for study, false data injection (FDI) attacks on wide-area Under-Frequency Load Shedding (UFLS) protection schemes are considered. Our analysis shows that attackers can drive the system out of stability by manipulating frequency measurements that are supplied to the control center by each local system. Then, we propose a detection strategy based on an unknown input estimator using Kalman filter, where frequencies as well as the power disturbance of system generators are estimated and compared with the received values. Then, a decision is made whether there is an attack or not based on the cumulative error residual.

Because phase steps are not the product of a permanent change in the underlying frequency, the paper proposes an algorithm to correct frequency estimates deemed erroneous. The algorithm makes use of the residual of the KF to determine when an estimate is incorrect and to trigger a corrective action in which the frequency estimate is replaced by an average of the previous values that were considered accurate.

	abstract = {Inter-area low frequency electromechanical oscillation deteriorates the stability of interconnected power system and limits the capacity of transmission system. In smart grid, with installation and development of phase measurement unit and wide-area measurement system, wide-area damping controller is a popular method to suppress electromechanical oscillation. However, the performance of wide-area damping controller will be deteriorated if associated sensors are corrupted or interrupted due to software/hardware failure. In this paper, Prony method and residue method are used to design a conventional wide-area damping controller firstly. Then, a novel federal-Kalman-filter-based fault-tolerant controller is proposed. Finally, the simulation verification is undertaken on a four-machine two-area parallel AC/DC system in MATLAB/Simulink. Compared with the conventional wide-area damping controller, the simulation results show that the proposed fault-tolerant wide-area damping controller is able to eliminate the electromechanical oscillation effectively when the remote feedback signal is subject to noise interference. © 2018 Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation.},

Balancing services such as frequency control require high accuracy and thus estimation is crucial, especially when sensing and communication in real time is not available or partially. We use Markov chain models to describe the thermal states of aggregated thermostatically controlled loads populations and belief propagation for state estimation. Kalman filter, which has been used in similar studies, is known to be an instance of belief propagation framework. This fact motivates us to introduce belief propagation in this framework, and demonstrate that it provides the same results as Kalman filter. Moreover, belief propagation algorithm is fully decentralized, offering higher flexibility of system modeling using factor graphs. Besides demand response, belief propagation can be applied for different purposes in power systems, either in fully distributed or in mixed systems, and is easily integrated with Kalman filter or similar probabilistic frameworks. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This study focuses on a system identification technique for a hydraulic based flight motion simulator (FMS). Because nonlinearities such as stiction and nonlinear orifice flow rate are often inherent in hydraulic systems, the system identification of the FMS can be very challenging. Simple non-parametric methods such as frequency response and step response methods have previously been used to estimate the parameters of the FMS model. These methods can sometimes provide inadequate results since the parameters are timevariant. Sophisticated parametric methods such as Extended Kalman filter, Unscented Kalman filter and Particle filter have also been used to estimate dynamic responses of a nonlinear system. However, the performance of those filters, in terms of convergence stability and error, are subjected to the initial conditions of the filters. In practice, tuning of those initial conditions can be time consuming. This paper highlights a novel evolutionary system identification approach which takes advantage of the knowledge of the physical system, the power of a non-parametric method such as frequency response, and the simplicity of the linear Kalman filter. Experimental results have shown that the estimated response of the FMS matches very well with the measured response despite changes in the operating conditions. © 2015, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc.

With the first two parts addressed in our previous work, in this paper, we focus on the primary frequency control scheme design in the multilayer control architecture to stabilize frequency and maintain the active power balance within the distributed areas. We propose two stochastic tracking schemes based on the state-space representation of a synchronous generator: 1) reference-dynamics-based tracking and 2) reference-statistics-based tracking. We further extend the proposed optimal controllers by considering the realistic scenario of asynchronous load signals from different customers. To compensate for different delays seen by different customer signals, a Kalman-filter-based prediction scheme is proposed to estimate the correct reference signal. We show that the centralized reference prediction can equivalently be implemented distributively. Simulation results are presented, showing the performances of the proposed prediction and tracking schemes. © 2007-2012 IEEE.},

The proposed controller is the enhanced linear quadratic regulator (ELQR) which is the joined execution of both the Kalman filter (KF) and LQR based state feedback gain controller. Here, the three area power system contains the combination of reheat thermal generator, wind generator and hydro power system. The proposed controller KF is designed to assessment the required state variables at the expense of slight performance degradation. KF uses the state space matrices Q and R and the initial values for the calculation of gain values to assessment the real signal value. In light of the non-linear frequency variation of the three area system, the ELQR predicts the optimal state feedback gain parameters of the controller. This procedure guarantees the system frequency control under the load disturbance influence by minimizing the automatic control error (ACE) and the tie line power variation. The proposed methodology is executed in MATLAB/Simulink working stage and the outcomes are validated with the current techniques such as PSO, BFO, GA, FPA, LQR, LQR-KF and LQR-PSO techniques.

A closed-loop control system for APFs is proposed in order to address the control dynamic challenges related to low switching frequency modulation techniques.

	abstract = {Synchronized phasor and frequency measurements are key tools for the monitoring and management of modern power systems. In a dynamic scenario, it is fundamental to define algorithms that allow accurately measuring time-varying signals, with short latencies and high reporting rates. A dynamic phasor model can help the design of these algorithms and, in particular, of those based on Kalman filtering approach. In this paper, an Extended Kalman filter formulation that considers the Taylor expansions of amplitudes and phase angles in three-phase signals is introduced. The proposed dynamic model takes into account the inherent relationship among the phases and includes harmonics in a effective way. The performance of the method permitting both synchrophasor and frequency measurements are assessed by simulations, considering also the combined effect of dynamics and disturbances. The algorithm shows tracking capabilities and the flexibility which is mandatory to deal with different conditions. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a recursive filtering method based on Kalman filter is proposed for the sensor delay in each state measurement of power system. Due to sampling frequency in the power system is generally high in milliseconds, the network topology is unchanged and the system state does not change much, therefore the system state at the next moment can be approximately linear relationship with the current state of the system, so we can get the linear state equation. In the measurement, the sensor delay is a common phenomenon in the project, in order to solve this problem in the dynamic estimation of the power system, a reasonable observation model is established to make it more close to the actual measurement situation in this paper, where the delay variable satisfies the Bernoulli distribution. Moreover, assume that the noise is Gaussian white noise, and then on the basis of two equations, using Kalman filter and some mathematical methods to find the gain parameters under the minimum error, make the filtering algorithm complete. Simulations are carried out on the IEEE 5-bus test system. The simulation results shows that the effectiveness of the proposed filtering algorithm. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In modern power grids (PGs), load frequency control (LFC) is effectively employed to preserve the frequency within the allowable ranges. However, LFC dependence on information and communication technologies (ICTs) makes PGs vulnerable to cyber attacks. Manipulation of measured data and control commands known as false data injection attacks (FDIAs) can negatively affect grid frequency performance and destabilize PG. This paper investigates the frequency performance of an isolated PG under coordinated FDIAs. A control scheme based on the combination of a Kalman filter, a chi-square detector, and a linear quadratic Gaussian controller is proposed to detect and mitigate the coordinated FDIAs. The efficiency of the proposed control scheme is evaluated under two types of scaling and exogenous FDIAs. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed control scheme has significant capabilities to detect and mitigate the designed FDIAs.  © 2021 IEEE.},

For stable operation of power systems, the frequency of the system should be reserved within the nominal value. Towards this, the estimation of states is of supreme implication. In this paper, a comparison is made on the estimation of the states using Kalman estimator method and optimal control approach to the Automatic Generation Control (AGC) of an isolated power system. The performance of optimized Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) in pole placement is compared with Kalman estimator. Optimization algorithms such as Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization are used to optimize positive definite matrices Q and R, weighting matrices of a LQR controller. Kalman estimator estimates the states of the system by measuring only one output signal which in this paper is mentioned as the change in frequency for the system considered. The comparison is made on the basis of the mean of the variances of the output, using the mentioned approaches. Study is conducted under different noise levels for independent Monte Carlo simulations. Modeling of an isolated power system is done using Simulink/MATLAB.  © 2019 - IOS Press and the authors.

	abstract = {For the first time, IEEE Std. C37.118.1-2011 now provides metrics for PMU dynamic performance in terms of classes P and M filter designs. This paper attempts to determine whether fulfilling these requirements makes the PMU inherently well suited for stability control applications such as wide-area power system stabilizers (PSSs). In this aim, we considered two different frequency-adaptive approaches for class-P and -M compliance to ensure operation over a wide frequency range. The first is based on a finite-impulse response (FIR) with no overshoot in either the phase or the amplitude step responses, while the second is Kalman filter-based (EKF), which allows for a more refined out-of-band interference rejection at the cost of a phase step response with overshoot. These two approaches are benchmarked against Hydro-Québec's existing PSS requirements and the conclusion is that the total vector error-based response time is not indicative of the phase lag within the frequency band of interest, nor of the 3-dB bandwidth under sinusoidal amplitude/frequency modulation phenomena, which are key criteria when specifying PSS PMUs. Using simulated and field-recorded network fault responses, we also show that a class-M PMU is unsatisfactory for wide-area stabilizing control, unless its performance is improved during the fault period, which is not covered by Std.

There are many invalid signals, which will lead to the identification model inaccurate and worsen the low frequency oscillation of the power system. In order to suppress the low frequency oscillation, the effective signal selection is very important. In this paper, we propose a wide area effective signal selection method called KPCAK, which is based on the Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) and Kalman Filter Optimization. Firstly, the wide-area signal data from WAMS are obtained, through this KPCA method, we can extract some effective information from the wide-area signal data. Then with the help of Kalman filter, the selected signals can be optimized. Secondly, a new signal selection and optimization algorithm procedure is proposed. And then the convergence of this algorithm by the segmentation theory is proved in this paper. Finally, selected optimal signals are tested on 4-machine 2-area system verify whether they are suitable for identification model. Simulation results show that wide area signals can be obtained effectively compared with other methods. © 2020 ACM.},

	abstract = {This paper deals with microsatellite attitude determination systems which are a combination of a main estimator with high-power, high-precision sensors for higher accuracy estimation and a redundant estimator with low-power, lower-precision sensors for backup. Measurement data from all sensors in the redundant estimator are fused by the unscented Kalman filter to provide estimated attitude and the gyro bias values. Besides the accuracy of attitude sensors, the accuracy of this estimator depends largely on the selection of the process and measurement noise covariance matrices. In this paper, a novel real-time tuning unscented Kalman filter for redundant attitude estimator is introduced to tune these matrices efficiently in each filter step. The tuning process uses the estimated attitude of the main estimator as an independent truth reference data to calculate the cost function which is minimized by a downhill simplex algorithm. In the scheme developed in this paper a fine-tuning process is used, which results in faster convergence speed and higher estimated accuracy of the redundant estimator. Another important feature of the developed filter is that a flexibly estimated accuracy and system power consumption can be archived by choosing the duration and repeat frequency of turn-on time of the main estimator. © 2013 The Japan Society for Aeronautical and Space Sciences.},

	abstract = {At Helmholtz Zentrum Berlin two projects are being developed where continuous wave driven SRF cavities are being implemented: bERLinPro and BESSY-VSR. The almost negligible beam loading in these systems, allow operating at high loaded quality factors and thus narrow bandwidths. Thereby, microphonics' influence on the frequency response will dominate the performance of the cavities and the amount of needed forward power. The LTI model describing the cavity's field state is now a time varying system as detuning changes the state of the cavity. Moreover, the received feedback data like transmitted or reflected power will suffer from sensor errors and noises either inherent or caused by the environment. The mentioned uncertainties could be reduced by applying a mathematical process called Kalman filtering. As the object law is well known but not ideal in this case, the role of filter is to judge about which data is more trustworthy under “real” system conditions: theoretical value or the obtained measured. We have designed a Kalman Filter (KF) implementation dedicated for use in mTCA control system as a part of microphonics suppression subsystem. Here the method, design and first data test results are going to be presented. © 2017 CC-BY-3.0 and by the respective authors},

Compared to the conventional notch filters, the AMLKNF has a faster convergence rate and smaller signal loss. However, for using this method, we need to know the notch frequency which is the interference frequency to remove. Thus, we use the RSPWVD method, one of the time-frequency analysis methods. In addition, an adaptation logic is designed in the AMLKNF to adjust the notch depth according to the power of the jamming signal. Matlab-based simulations are performed for analyzing the performance of the proposed method. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can efficiently track and eliminate interference well compared to the conventional methods. © 2020, ICROS, KIEE and Springer.},

The energy beamforming is a key technology to resolve a low energy transfer efficiency problem of the RF energy transfer system, which is mainly caused by a free-space path loss. The channel gains between transmit and receive antennas should be estimated to use the energy beamforming technique. We propose a received power-based channel estimation scheme that can be implemented by means of a simple power meter at a receiver. In the proposed scheme, the receiver measures the received power of the RF signal and sends a feedback containing the received power measurements to the transmitter. We formulate a channel estimation problem, which is recast into a linear estimation problem by using complex vectorization. Then, this linear estimation problem is solved by the ordinary least squares method and the Kalman filter-based algorithm. We also propose a method to reduce the dimension of the estimation problem when there are a smaller number of receive antennas than transmit antennas. © 1991-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The frequency behavior of an electric power system right after a power imbalance is determined by its inertia constant. The current shift in generation mix towards renewable energy sources is leading to a smaller and more variable inertia, thereby compromising the frequency stability of modern grids. Therefore, real-time inertia estimation methods would be beneficial for grid operators, as their situational awareness would be enhanced. This paper focuses on an inertia estimation method specifically tailored for synchronous generators, based on the extended Kalman filter (EKF). Such a method should be started at the time of disturbance, which must be estimated accurately, otherwise additional errors could be introduced in the inertia estimation process. In this paper, the sensitivity of the EKF-based inertia estimation method to the assumed time of disturbance is analyzed. It is shown that such sensitivity is influenced by the initially assumed inertia constant, the use time of the filter and by the time required for primary frequency regulation to be activated. c 2019 by the authors.},

The case-study MG includes sporadic renewable sources that lead to significant frequency and voltage fluctuations in the network. The rules of suggested T2FLCs are tuned such that a fractional-order sliding condition can be satisfied. Also a new approach using square-root-cubature Kalman filter is designed to optimize the membership parameters of T2FLCs. Beside AP/RP power regulation, an electrical storage system (battery energy storage system (BESS)) is managed to produce the rated power, rather than a conventional generator. It makes the device frequency separate from the synchronous generator’s mechanical inertia. Nevertheless, a BESS has a power limit – it uses a synchronous generator to sustain the BESS charge state at a certain value. Sustainable energies achieve a voltage-damping impact by supplementing an AP/RP droop strategy procedure that considerably reduces voltage oscillation created by variation of its own output power. In various disturbed scenarios the good performance of the suggested controller and energy management system is shown. © The Author(s) 2021.},

Using the total least-squares (TLS) method, it is possible to estimate the model parameters while compensating for error in both input and output of the model when the voltage readings of the three phases are contaminated with noise. In this paper, we utilize the inverse power method to find a TLS estimate of the parameters of the assumed widely-linear predictive model in an adaptive fashion. Simulation results show that the resultant algorithm, called augmented inverse power iterations (AIPI), outperforms the recently proposed augmented complex Kalman filter (ACKF) and augmented complex extended Kalman filter (ACEKF) algorithms in estimating the frequency of the three-phase power systems. Unlike ACKF and ACEKF, AIPI requires no parameter tuning or prior knowledge of the noise variances. Computational complexity of AIPI is also similar to those of ACKF and ACEKF. © 2013 IEEE.},

The NMPC is based on a simplified system model that is updated using state- and parameter estimation by Kalman filters, and it takes into account limitations on among others tie-line power flow. Tests on a proxy of the Nordic power system show that the RNMPC is able to fulfill system constraints under worst-case deviations in wind-power production, where the nominal NMPC is not. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a novel primary frequency regulation (PFR) scheme for multi-infeed high voltage direct current (HVDC) (MIDC) system. First, a dynamic model for frequency response in the MIDC system is carried out to involve line-commutated-coveter (LCC)-HVDCs in frequency regulation. Then, a disturbance observer (DO) is proposed to estimate both the power imbalance and the full order states of the system. By combining a Kalman filter, this DO gets an accurate estimation quickly with local frequency measurement. On the basis of the estimated disturbance and state variables, feedforward control schemes can be concluded to fully utilize the fast adjustability of LCC-HVDCs. In this paper, a model predictive control based scheme is designed to coordinate LCC-HVDCs under constraints of HVDC capacity and frequency boundaries. As a result, the optimal power-sharing property of LCC-HVDCs is achieved to enhance the PFR dynamic performance of the AC main system. Further, the stability of the proposed method is analysed using the Lyapunov method. Finally, numerical simulations are concluded to verify the effectiveness and the merits of the proposed method, by comparing it to typical droop controls. © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {Protection-oriented (P Class) phasor measurement units (PMUs) are required to reconcile high measurement accuracy and low latency in order to promptly detect possible anomalous operating conditions in power systems. Most of the existing estimators of synchrophasor magnitude, phase, frequency, and rate of change of frequency (ROCOF) of voltage or current AC waveforms need to acquire the samples of at least two power line cycles to meet the P Class requirements specified in the IEEE/IEC Standard 60255-118-1:2018. In this article, instead, a multistep technique based on the combination of multiple signal classification (MUSIC), narrowband disturbance whitening, and Taylor-Kalman Filtering (TKF) is proposed to maximize accuracy even over one-cycle-long observation intervals. Both MUSIC and disturbance whitening rely on a common theoretical framework (i.e., signal and noise vector subspace decomposition) and they are applied to compensate for the detrimental effect of off-nominal frequency deviations and harmonic distortion, respectively. The use of cascaded dynamic estimators such as the TKF is motivated by the need to track possible in-band amplitude and phase oscillations or step-like changes with low latency. While the basic TKF is very sensitive to possible narrowband disturbances, the tuned whitening-based TKF (TW-TKF) described in this article ensures superior accuracy under the influence of harmonics and amplitude or phase step changes, with just a minor performance degradation in the other P Class testing conditions reported in the IEEE/IEC Standard 60255-118-1:2018.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

These improvements offer better monitoring, control, and protection for effective power flow management in the electrical network. These dependencies of information hamper the system's operation in the existence of any cyber-attacks. The effect of these attacks must be mitigated by compensating for these attacks so that normality can be restored. This work tests an H infinity-based filtering technique to detect the attack signal like step and sine attacks. The test is performed in a two-area power system connected through a tie-line for power exchange. Automatic generation control (AGC) tries to maintain the frequency to a nominal value by providing the essential area control error (ACE) signals to the area controllers. The proposed filter works better than the Kalman fflter in the presence of non-Gaussian noises, also with high noise magnitudes. Further validation is camed out in a test environment consisting of a real-time digtal simulator (RTDS) and Raspberry Pi 4 board connected through an Ethernet]ink. The communication structure incorporated server-client-based TCP/IP socket protocol to transfer test environment information.  © 2023 IEEE.},

This technique initially allocates the power to subcarriers uniformly, and then gives an approximate equivalent channel gain model. Since OFDM is sensitive to frequency offset among the transmitted and received carrier frequencies, the Inter-Carrier Interference (ICI) is mitigated using the techniques such as ICI Self-Cancellation and Extended Kalman Filter (EKF).

	abstract = {Accurate information about generator rotor speeds and angles plays an important role for power system transient stability online assessment and protection. To address this need, this paper proposes a fast and robust estimation approach based on the model transformation strategy. Thanks to this strategy, the original complex nonlinear model is transformed into a linear one without linerization, which makes the dynamical system observability analysis and the estimation problem significantly easier to solve. The proposed model transformation strategy is achieved by taking the measured generator active power as the input variable and the derived frequency and the rate of change of frequency measurements from the phasor measurement units (PMUs) as the output variables of the dynamical generator model. This allows us to estimate the generator rotor speeds and angles using only local PMU measurements and the swing equations, relaxing the need of a detailed generator model on which the existing dynamic state estimators are based. A robust Kalman filter is also developed to handle data quality problems as the frequency and rate of change of frequency measurements can be biased in presence of severe disturbance or communication issues. Comparison results carried out on the IEEE 39-bus system successfully validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach under various conditions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

This work aims to design an FPGA filter circuit to phases detecting as well as the value of its current and voltage feedback.

It puts forward a scheme of a fast synchronous grid connection function of the regional power grid with high permeability hydropower, and points out the necessity of having increasing frequency change rate as the criterion of fast synchronous grid connection and the criterion of high-frequency protection of hydropower units.

BESS is used to reduce the frequency deviations caused by wind energy, and DR is utilized to increase network stability due to fast load changes. The suggested T2FLC is online tuned based on the extended Kalman filter to improve the LFC accuracy in coordination of DR, BESS, and wind farms.

	abstract = {To achieve frequency regulation, energy-storage systems (ESSs) are systems that monitor and maintain the grid frequency. In South Korea, the total installed capacity of battery ESSs (BESSs) is 376 MW, and these have been employed to achieve frequency regulation since 2015. When the frequency of a power grid is input, accurately estimating the state of charge (SOC) of a battery is difficult because it charges or discharges quickly according to the frequency regulation algorithm. If the SOC of a battery cannot be estimated, the battery can be used in either a high SOC or low SOC. This makes the battery unstable and reduces the safety of the ESS system. Therefore, it is important to precisely estimate the SOC. This paper proposes a technique to estimate the SOC in the test pattern of a frequency regulation ESS using extended Kalman filters. In addition, unlike the conventional extended Kalman filter input with a fixed-error covariance, the SOC is estimated using an adaptive extended Kalman filter (AEKF) whose error covariance is updated according to the input data. Noise is likely to exist in the environment of frequency regulation ESSs, and this makes battery-state estimation more difficult. Therefore, significant noise has been added to the frequency regulation test pattern, and this study compares and verifies the estimation performance of the proposed AEKF and a conventional extended Kalman filter using measurement data with severe noise. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Accurate measurement of the rotor angle and speed of synchronous generators is instrumental in developing powerful local or wide-area control and monitoring systems to enhance power grid stability and reliability. Exogenous input signals such as field voltage and mechanical torque are critical information in this context, but obtaining them raises significant logistical challenges, which in turn complicates the estimation of the generator dynamic states from easily available terminal phasor measurement unit (PMU) signals only. To overcome these issues, the authors of this paper employ the extended Kalman filter with unknown inputs, referred to as the EKF-UI technique, for decentralized dynamic state estimation of a synchronous machine states using terminal active and reactive powers, voltage phasor and frequency measurements. The formulation is fully decentralized without single-machine infinite bus (SMIB) or excitation model assumption so that only local information is required. It is demonstrated that using the decentralized EKF-UI scheme, synchronous machine states can be estimated accurately enough to enable wide-area power system stabilizers (WA-PSS) and system integrity protection schemes (SIPS). Simulation results on New-England test system, Hydro-Québec simplified system, and Kundur network highlight the efficiency of the proposed method under fault conditions with electromagnetic transients and full-order generator models in realistic multi-machine setups. © 1969-2012 IEEE.},

The wind energy conversion system model is represented by a Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy (TSF) model. The finite frequency approach is proposed to control the closed-loop system in an operating finite frequency domain. However, when the external perturbations belong to a certain frequency range which is unknown before and less than the operating range that is given by manufacturer, the control in the full operating range of frequency may degrade system performance. Therefore, the artificial neural network (ANN) is employed to predict the actual operating frequency domain. The controller conditions are given in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which are designed using generalized Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov (GKYP). Finally, the simulation results demonstrated that the performance of the proposed control strategy is significantly better than the control in the full frequency range, and the maximum wind power tracking can be reached effectively. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Network based wide-area controls will form an important part of smart grid implementation to improve power system stability. The performance of such control systems can seriously deteriorate under various network uncertainties such as time-varying delays, packet loss, and packet disorder. To address these issues, an Adaptive Time Delay Compensation (ATDC) scheme has been suggested to design wide area damping controller for a Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS). The proposed TDC scheme is based on a direct phase advancement methodology that requires the signal modal information such as amplitude, frequency, and damping. This information has been utilized to compensate the latency by predicting the future trajectories of oscillatory response. An Adaptive Extended Kalman Filter (AEKF) is employed to estimate the low-frequency oscillatory modes with missing measurement data. To compensate the error due to packet disorder, a new methodology of packet-reordering, has been proposed. Further, the Wide-Area Damping Controller (WADC) is designed addressing the issue of sampled data control. The performance of the proposed scheme has been validated on the 16-machine, 68-bus power system. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

This is particularly important for protection-oriented (i.e., P Class) PMUs. In order to improve estimation accuracy with no need to prolong the data record size and the related delays, this paper presents a Taylor Kalman Filter (TKF) enhanced with a preliminary stage able to whiten possible narrowband disturbances over short observation intervals. The use of dynamic estimators such as the TKF is motivated by the need to track possible sudden amplitude or phase changes of voltage or current AC waveforms, which are likely to occur in smart grids. However, while a basic TKF is very sensitive to disturbances different from white noise, the proposed whitening-Technique is able to greatly improve the estimation accuracy of synchrophasor amplitude, phase, frequency and Rate of Change of Frequency (ROCOF) under the influence of harmonics and amplitude or phase step changes even over one-cycle observation intervals, with just a minor performance degradation in the other P Class testing conditions reported in the IEEE/IEC Standard 60255-118-1:2018.  © 2021 IEEE.},

In modern large-scale power grids, the number of deployed meters and the frequency of collecting data have remarkably increased. Such a growth in the spatiotemporal size of collected data overwhelms the existing monitoring system with a centralized star structure. Streaming of data from all meters of the network to the central control center also increases communication latency. To overcome these challenges, the power system is partitioned into subsystems with local estimators, and the DSE process is distributed among local estimators. The distributed DSE is hosted at regional control centers and utilizes distributed extended Kalman filtering based on internodal transformation theory to estimate the dynamic states of power systems. The local estimators only require data within their own subsystem, and information is exchanged only between neighboring subsystems. The proposed distributed DSE is implemented on a 68-bus test system, and its accuracy is demonstrated. © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

These harmonics create stress on electrical devices connected to the power system. These harmonics also cause failure of devicesand/or create disturbances in performance of devices. Hence this sets a requirement of harmonic filters. However, before designing a filter, the process of harmonic analysis is essential. This paper describes the design of an Extended Kalman filter for PWM converter for harmonic detection. Measurement of magnitudes and frequencies of fundamental and harmonic components present in system voltage and current waveformsare detected in this paper. The result of this filter are compared with the results of Fast Fourier transform (FFT) function in MATLAB.

Fundamental to the functioning of this controller is the estimation of a phasor representing oscillations at a particular frequency in a measured signal. The phasor is transformed to time domain and applied as a setpoint signal to a controllable device. The contribution in this paper specifically targets the estimation algorithm of the controller: It is found that improved estimation accuracy and thereby enhanced damping performance can be achieved by introducing a prediction-correction scheme for the estimator, in the form of a Kalman Filter. The prediction of the phasor at the next step is performed based on the control signal that is applied at the current step. This enables more precise damping of the targeted mode. The presented results, which are obtained from simulations on a Single-Machine Infinite Bus system and the IEEE 39-Bus system, indicate that the proposed enhancement improves the performance of this type of controller. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Combined estimation of state and feed-back gain for optimal load frequency control is proposed. Load frequency control (LFC) addresses the problem of controlling system frequency in response to disturbance, and is one of main research areas in power system operation. A well acknowledged solution to this problem is feedback stabilization, where the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) based controller computes the feedback gain K from the known system parameters and implements the control, assuming the availability of all the state variables. However, this approach restricts control to cases where the state variables are readily available and the system parameters are steady. Alternatively, by estimating the states continuously from available measurements of some of the states, it can accommodate dynamic changes in the system parameters. The paper proposes the technique of augmenting the state variables with controller gains. This introduces a non-linearity to the augmented system and thereby the estimation is performed using an Extended Kalman Filter. This results in producing controller gains that are capable of controlling the system in response to changes in load demand, system parameter variation and measurement noise. © 2020, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Aiming at the GNSS receiver vulnerability in challenging urban environments and low power consumption of integrated navigation systems, an improved robust adaptive Kalman filter (IRAKF) algorithm with real-time performance and low computation complexity for single-frequency GNSS/MEMS-IMU/odometer integrated navigation module is proposed. The algorithm obtains the scale factor by the prediction residual, and uses it to adjust the artificially set covariance matrix of the observation vector under different GNSS solution states, so that the covariance matrix of the observation vector changes continuously with the complex scene. Then, the adaptive factor is calculated by the Mahalanobis distance to inflate the state prediction covariance matrix. In addition, the one-step prediction Kalman filter is introduced to reduce the computational complexity of the algorithm. The performance of the algorithm is verified by vehicle experiments in the challenging urban environments. Experiments show that the algorithm can effectively weaken the effects of abnormal model deviations and outliers in the measurements and improve the positioning accuracy of real-time integrated navigation. It can meet the requirements of low power consumption real-time vehicle navigation applications in the complex urban environment. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

The mmWave MIMO hybrid architecture provides reduced power loss and achievable data rates at mmWave frequencies. Frequency-selective channels are sparse at mmWave frequencies. The recovery of the sparse channel is estimated using different channel estimation methods. The hybrid precoding technique achieves both multiplexing gain and array gain in mmWave channels.

	abstract = {With the knowledge of adverse effects of harmonics in power systems, parameters (amplitude, frequency, phase, and harmonic contents) estimation of a signal have attracted a rising interest. In recent years sparse representation of a signal has shown a growing interest over the existing techniques that follow Shannon/Nyquist sampling theorem, which requires large storage space, huge computational time, and moreover, the overall process is cost-effective. Keeping in mind the flaws of the conventional methods, this paper presents a novel sparse power system domain based cubature Kalman filter (SPSD-CKF) algorithm, which is the completely new framework that exploits the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP), a sparse coding algorithm, and K-SVD, a learned dictionary, for sparse representation of a signal. The K-SVD contains the prototype signal-atoms where the signals are described by sparse linear combinations of these atoms, is flexible one and can work with any pursuit method. On the other hand, the OMP is easy to implement and takes less time. The CKF is utilized to estimate the amplitude, phase, frequency, and harmonics using fewer measurements in the sparse domain. To examine the efficacy of learning-based dictionary obtained using the K-SVD, some well-known static dictionaries such as Gabor dictionary (GD) and an overcomplete hybrid dictionary (OHD) have been adopted and their results are compared. Various simulation results suggest that the proposed algorithm provides an efficient mechanism to estimate the parameters and also robust against the noise. © 2019 IEEE.},

An estimation method based on Kalman filtering (KF) is proposed to exploit the temporal TSC correlation between the pulses in the frequency domain. To minimize the mean square error of the estimated TSC at each KF iteration, unlike existing indirect methods, in this paper the radar waveform is optimized directly under the constraints of transmitted power, peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) and detection probability. Since the optimization problem regarding the waveform design is non-convex, a novel method is proposed to convert this problem into a convex one. Simulation results demonstrate that the performance of the TSC estimation for the temporally correlated target is significantly improved by radar waveform optimization. Meanwhile, no performance degradation is observed with the introduction of the additional PAPR constraints and the detection constraints for KF estimation with the optimized waveform. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

The wide area measurement system based on synchronized phasor measurement unit (PMU) of distribution network is considered as an effective way to solve the problem. However, existing synchronization clock algorithm using low-cost crystal oscillator can hardly meet the requirements of high accuracy, high stability and low cost for the PMU of distribution network. In order to meet the demand of PMU application in distribution network, this paper proposes a timing/time keeping algorithm based on Kalman filter and BP neural network. Based on the mathematical models of satellite signal error and crystal oscillator frequency, Kalman filter is used to eliminate the error of satellite signal to improve timing accuracy and provide accurate crystal oscillator state data. The data are used to train a BP neural network model, describing the aging rule of crystal vibration frequency and improving the time keeping performance. In thescenario of normalaccess and losing lock of satellite signal, the tests are carried out based on the measured data of actual clock device. Results show that the algorithm proposed in this paper can effectively improve the performance of synchronous clock without increasing cost of existing hardware. © 2019, Power System Technology Press.

An augmented measurement Jacobian matrix is formed considering system states and frequency as variables to be estimated along the time. Distributed generation is connected to the grid by voltage source inverters (VSI) considering frequency and voltage droop control characteristics. A radial 18-bus test system is used for the computational simulations in order to prove the efficiency of the proposed methodology. The algorithm is tested considering microgrid in grid-connected and islanded operation modes providing satisfactory results with reduced estimation errors when compared to the RSCAD (Real-Time Simulation Software Package) software. The main contributions of this work include: (i) the explicit model of frequency and voltage droop control of VSI in a Kalman filter model; (ii) the capability of tracking microgrids frequency and system states along the time; (iii) the explicit model of derivatives of phasor measurement units and smart meters measurements with respect to the system states and frequency. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Interfacing power converters to the power grid requires an L or LC or LCL filter to reduce the switching frequency ripple. Among the options mentioned above, the LCL filter provides good performance at a lower cost due to the reduced size of used inductors. However, stability problems occur in the converter control system if the present resonance is not decently damped. Damping can be either passive or active. Passive damping inserts a physical resistor to one of the components of the LCL-filter in series or parallel. A simple process yet causes increased power losses and encumbrances. In contrast, active damping is an entire control solution, allowing the system to remain resonance-free without dissipative elements but requiring auxiliary sensors to build feedback loops. The lead-lag network method is one of the most used procedures to incorporate active damping for its feasibility. However, an additional sensor is still required, meaning additional cost and noise are introduced to the system. Thus, this paper uses Kalman Filter to estimate the capacitor voltage to build the lead-lag network damping method. On account of the Kalman filter accuracy and reactivity, it is selected and verified in the following paper. Simulations results of the Kalman-based damping method show similar results as with a sensor. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Effective real-time state estimation is essential for smart grid synchronization, as electricity demand continues to grow, and renewable energy resources increase their penetration into the grid. In order to provide a more reliable state estimation technique to address the problem of bad data in the PMU-based power synchronization, this paper presents a novel nonlinear estimation framework to dynamically track frequency, voltage magnitudes and phase angles. Instead of directly analyzing in abc coordinate frame, symmetrical component transformation is employed to separate the positive, negative, and zero sequence networks. Then, Clarke's transformation is used to transform the sequence networks into the α β stationary coordinate frame, which leads to system model formulation. A novel fault tolerant extended Kalman filter based real-time estimation framework is proposed for smart grid synchronization with noisy bad data measurements. Computer simulation studies have demonstrated that the proposed fault tolerant extended Kalman filter (FTEKF) provides more accurate voltage synchronization results than the extended Kalman filter (EKF). The proposed approach has been implemented with dSPACE DS1103 and National Instruments CompactRIO hardware platforms. Computer simulation and hardware instrumentation results have shown the potential applications of FTEKF in smart grid synchronization. © 2016 IEEE.},

Quick and precise positive/negative sequence extraction of the grid voltage is the major challenge in synchronization. Phase-locked loop (PLL) is well known method for phase angle and frequency detection. Up to now numerous PLL based techniques are proposed to perform this task. This paper deals with the proposing a modified Kalman-filter based PLL (KF-PLL). The performance of this PLL depends on how to properly tune the frequency identifier system. Therefore to enhance the performance of this PLL a fuzzy based technique is proposed which effectively makes the Kalman-based PLL better. The designed fuzzy system adjusts ku parameter which is responsible for speed of the convergence of real time frequency identifier block of the KF-PLL system. The proposed detection system is simple, and precisely finds the fundamental component of grid voltage within one cycle, that is fast enough for almost all synchronization application. Meanwhile, the method guaranties the zero steady state error in complicated harmonic scenarios, including all typical single phase and three phase harmonics. The simulation results depict the influence of fuzzy logic technique on KF-PLL improvement. © 2015 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.},

In this study, a simple voltage sensorless multi-loop control method is proposed for the single-phase UPS inverter and the parameters are designed systematically based on a frequency domain method. The suggested control scheme uses two nested simple proportional controllers instead of proportional-integral/resonant controllers to regulate the output voltage and produce active resonance damping. In addition, a feedforward compensation of the reference voltage is used to enhance the performance of the control system. The proposed controller does not need any reference frame transformation or integration/derivation of measured quantities in its structure. To reduce the cost and at the same time to improve the reliability of the converter system, the output voltage sensor is replaced by a simple estimation algorithm based on the digital Kalman filter. Experimental results with a 500 VA prototype, as well as simulation results validate the excellent performance of the suggested estimation and control scheme. © 2015.

However, there are still plenty of challenges related to this technology, especially in terms of Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) fluctuations due to the behaviour of the channels and the multipath effect, that lead to poor precision. In order to mitigate these effects, in this paper we propose and implement a real Indoor Positioning System based on Bluetooth Low Energy, that improves accuracy while reducing power consumption and costs. The three main proposals are: frequency diversity, Kalman filtering and a trilateration method what we have denominated “weighted trilateration”. The analysis of the results proves that all the proposals improve the precision of the system, which goes up to 1.82 m 90% of the time for a device moving in a middle-size room and 0.7 m for static devices. Furthermore, we have proved that the system is scalable and efficient in terms of cost and power consumption. The implemented approach allows using a very simple device (like a SensorTag) on the items to locate. The system enables a very low density of anchor points or references and with a precision better than existing solutions. © 2017 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

While most research in distributed adaptive signal processing is conducted in the real and complex domains, inherently in many real-world applications the data sources are three-dimensional. This scenario is ideally suited for quaternions in terms of both convenience of representation and mathematical tractability. In this paper, we expand the concept of distributed Kalman filtering to the quaternion domain in order to develop a robust distributed quaternion Kalman filtering algorithm for data fusion over sensor networks dealing with three-dimensional data. For rigor, the mean and mean square behavior of the algorithm are analyzed.

In this sense, the reliability in which such parameters are determined shows to be crucial to the entire system operation. In this article, we propose the estimation of both phasors and parameters through a nonlinear approach by using the Kronecker product, in order to determine the Jacobian terms, and thereafter the extended Kalman filter (EKF). The parameters estimation is carried out recursively in the d - q domain, based on the phasor rotation dynamics for a given frequency. The results presented a reliable and accurate estimation compared to another approach based on Kalman Filtering method. The nonlinear approach, applying the Kronecker product and EKF, represents the original contribution of the proposed estimation method. Besides, this method is applicable to large systems, since the transmission line have to be modeled by the equivalent π model using the hyperbolic corrections.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Increasing penetration levels of asynchronous wind turbine generators (WTG) reduce the ability of the power system to maintain adequate frequency responses. WTG with the installation of battery energy storage systems (BESS) as wind-storage systems (WSS), not only reduce the intermittency but also provide a frequency response. Meanwhile, many studies indicate that using the dynamic droop coefficient of WSS in primary frequency control (PFC) based on the prediction values, is an effective way to enable the performance of WSS similar to conventional synchronous generators. This paper proposes a PFC for WSS with a prediction-based droop coefficient (PDC) according to the re-bid process under real-time spot market rules. Specifically, WSS update the values of the reference power and droop coefficient discretely at every bidding interval using near-term wind power and frequency prediction, which enables WSS to be more dispatchable in the view of transmission system operators (TSOs). Also, the accurate prediction method in the proposed PDC-PFC achieves the optimal arrangement of power from WTG and BESS in PFC. Finally, promising simulation results for a hybrid power system show the efficacy of the proposed PDC-PFC for WSS under different operating conditions. © 2018 by the authors.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a fast and robust dynamic state estimation technique based on model transformation method using the proposed hybrid technique. The proposed hybrid method is the combination of Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) and Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), hence commonly referred to as the UKF-GBDT technique. The proposed model transformation approach is accomplished by taking the active power generator measured as input variable and derived frequency as rate of change of frequency measurements of phasor measurement units (PMU) as dynamic generator output variable model. The proposed hybrid technique is also formulated to deal with data quality issues, and the rate of change of frequency and frequency measurements may be skewed in the presence of rigorous disruption or communication problems. This permits to obtain discrete-Time linear dynamic equations in state space based on the linear Kalman filter (LKF). With this proper control, this model alleviates filter divergence problems, which can be a severe issue if the nonlinear model is utilized in greatly strained operating system conditions, and gives quick estimate of rotor speeds together with angles through transient modes if only the transient stability with control is concerned. In the case of long-Term dynamics, the outcome of governor's response in long-Term system dynamics is offset together with mechanical power at rotor speed and the state vector angles for joint evaluation. At last, the performance of the proposed method is simulated in MATLAB/Simulink and the performance is compared to the existing methods like UKF, GBDT and ANN. The proposed technique is simulated under three case studies like IEEE 14-, 30-And 118-bus systems.  © 2022 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

	abstract = {Countries worldwide are embracing the trend toward smart grids, depending on advanced technology and communication networks. However, the smart grid is more vulnerable to cyberattacks than its traditional counterpart, especially the false data injection attack (FDIA), which aims to add false data into the transmitted signals to cause undesirable behavior. This article proposes a new scheme to detect and estimate the FDIA on load frequency control (LFC) of modern interconnected power systems considering renewable energy sources (RESs) and high voltage direct current (HVDC) link. The proposed scheme is based on the Kalman filter (KF) and artificial neural networks (ANNs). The KF is used to detect the FDIA in the transmitted system signals and indicates the possibility of an attack in each transmitted signal, where the role of ANNs is to estimate the transmitted signal before attacking. Hence, based on KF and ANNs, the proposed scheme can ensure the detection of false data and remove the attack simultaneously. The proposed cyber-security scheme is considered a thorough solution that can effectively reduce the impact of the FDIA on any of the four transmitted signals within the two-area interconnected power system, all while simulating the virtual inertia control strategy. The simulation results of the studied low-inertia interconnected power system are carried out using MATLAB/Simulink® software. The simulation results successfully demonstrate the proposed scheme's efficacy, accuracy, and acceptability to detect and eliminate the FDIA on the LFC of low-inertia interconnected power grids. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This study deals with multi-path channel estimation for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems under slow to moderate fading conditions. Advanced algorithms exploit the channel time-domain correlation by using Kalman filters (KFs) based on an approximation of the time-varying channel. Recently, it was shown that under slow to moderate fading, near-optimal channel multi-path complex amplitude estimation can be obtained by using the integrated random walk (RW) model as the channel approximation. To reduce the complexity of the high-dimensional RW-KF for joint estimation of the multi-path complex amplitudes, we propose using a lower dimensional RW-KF that estimates the complex amplitude of each path separately. We demonstrate that this amounts to a simplification of the joint multi-path Kalman gain formulation through the Woodbury's identities. Hence, this new algorithm consists of a superposition of independent single-path single-carrier KFs, which were optimized in our previous studies. This observation allows us to adapt the optimization to the actual multi-path multi-carrier scenario, to provide analytic formulas for the mean-square error performance and the optimal tuning of the proposed estimator directly as a function of the physical parameters of the channel (Doppler frequency, signal-to-noise-ratio, power delay profile). These analytic formulae are given for the first-, second-, and third-order RW models used in the KF. The proposed per-path KF is shown to be as efficient as the exact KF (i.e., the joint multi-path KF), and outperforms the autoregressive-model-based KFs proposed in the literature. © 1991-2012 IEEE.},

Kalman Filter based techniques are used to estimate these states locally. Wide Area Power System control based on state space model of the system requires remote monitoring of states. Phasor Measurement Units (PMU) are widely used for remote monitoring and control, but the remote measurements are limited to output measurement like voltage, current, and frequency. Traditional Kalman Filter based techniques require both input and output measurements of the generator in order to estimate the states. This paper proposes the application of an input invariant filter technique for remote estimation of generator states using the limited PMU measurements, even in the absence of mechanical input torque and field voltage measurements.

Secondary/load frequency controllers are used for compensating the power mismatch in the time-scale of up to several minutes. The Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control has been applied for regulating the frequency. However, the parameters in the LQG method are conventionally determined using trial and error methods. This makes the selection process challenging for large power system and cannot guarantee satisfactory response. In this paper, an optimal load frequency control (LFC) method is proposed where the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method is exploited to optimize the selection of LQG parameters for a multi-area system. The performance of the proposed LQG+PSO method is verified on a test-bench three-area system using simulations. It is demonstrated that the proposed LQG+PSO method achieves superior frequency regulation compared to the conventional LQG method. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The ability to maintain the system frequency within specified operating limits is crucial for the stability and proper operation of power systems. Any small deviation out of the permissible frequency range must be well-mitigated by the automatic generation control (AGC) system, otherwise it may result in disruption of operation and/or damage to the power grid equipment. The data required by the AGC control system is sent to the control center through communication links which are susceptible to cyber attacks. Therefore, such AGC systems have to be well-protected against false data injection (FDI) attacks. In this paper, the use of a simultaneous input and state estimation based algorithm to detect and concurrently compensate for FDI attacks against the measurements of AGC systems is investigated. Throughout the use of this algorithm, the FDI attack signal is dealt with as an unknown input and its value is estimated accordingly. Then, the estimated value for the FDI is used to compensate for the effect of the attack so that the control center makes its decision based on the corrected sensor signals, and not the manipulated ones. The proposed approach is tested under different types of FDI attacks and the simulation results for a 2-area and a 4-area practical system confirm its ability to detect, estimate FDI attacks and successfully compensate for it. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In this paper, load frequency regulator based on linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) is designed for the multi-area power system (MAPS) with communication delays. The communication delay is considered to denote the small time delay in a local control area of a wide-area power system. The system is modeled in the state space with inclusion of the delay state matrix parameters. Since some state variables are difficult to measure in a real modern multi-area power system, Kalman filter is used to estimate the unmeasured variables. In addition, the controller with the optimal feedback gain reduces the frequency spikes to zero and keeps the system stable. Lyapunov function based on the linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique is used to re-assure the asymptotically stability and the convergence of the estimator error. The designed LQG is simulated in a two area connected power network with considerable time delay. The result from the simulations indicates that the controller performed with expectation in terms of damping the frequency fluctuations and area control errors. It also solved the limitation of other controllers which need to measure all the system state variables. © 2022 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Positioning accuracy and power consumption are essential performance indicators of integrated navigation and positioning chips. This paper proposes a single-frequency GNSS/MEMS-IMU/odometer real-time high-precision integrated navigation algorithm with dynamic power adaptive adjustment capability in complex environments. It is implemented in a multi-sensor fusion navigation SiP (system in package) chip. The simplified INS algorithm and the simplified Kalman filter algorithm are adopted to reduce the computation load, and the strategy of adaptively adjusting the data rate and selecting the observation information for measurement update in different scenes and motion modes is combined to realize high-precision positioning and low power consumption in complex scenes. The performance of the algorithm is verified by re-al-time vehicle experiments in a variety of complex urban environments. The results show that the RMS statistical value of the overall positioning error in the entire road section is 0.312 m, and the overall average power consumption is 141 mW, which meets the requirements of real-time integrated navigation for high-precision positioning and low power consumption. It supports single-frequency GNSS/MEMS-IMU/odometer integrated navigation SiP chip in real-time, high-precision, low-power, and small-volume applications. © 2021 by the authors.

However, the frame size in read cycle is usually far from optimal when the reader does not know the number of unidentified tags in its interrogation zone, and this will lead to several performance issues and technical limitations such as power consumption, longer reading time, and degraded system performance. In this paper, we show that the number of unidentified tags can be expressed as a function of the collision rate received by the reader when the reader collects tags' information, and then we use an extended Kalman filter-based tag number estimation algorithm to estimate the number of unidentified tags in an RFID system on run-time measurements.

A new observation model is raised in the proposed scheme to make the state estimation more accurate. The process noise covariance (Q) and the measurement noise covariance (R) are adaptively estimated to make them consistent with their theoretical covariance. For verification of the feasibility of the proposed scheme, corresponding simulations of carrier recovery in satellite-to-ground laser links are carried out and compared with the scheme that is based on linear Kalman filter (LKF). The simulation results demonstrate that, compared with parallelized LKF, the proposed scheme has a wider range of block size and laser linewidth options, and it can relax the required transmit power by up to 0.5-3 dB under different zenith angle at the same BER. Moreover, the proposed scheme can achieve high estimation accuracy and fast tracking capability simultaneously in the case of dynamic frequency offset with better tolerance against the initial errors in Q and R. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

The time-varying system is first decomposed into several interconnected subsystems. Interactions between subsystems are obtained by a distributed Kalman filter, in which unknown parameters of the system are estimated using local measurements and measurements of neighboring subsystems that are available via a network. Quadratic boundedness is used to guarantee the stability of the closed-loop system. In the MPC algorithm, an output feedback-interaction feedforward control input is computed by an LMI-based optimization problem that minimizes an upper bound on the worst case value of an infinite-horizon objective function. Then, an iterative Nash-based algorithm is presented to achieve the overall optimal solution of the whole system in partially distributed fashion. Finally, the proposed distributed MPC approach is applied to a load frequency control (LFC) problem of a multi-area power network to study the efficiency and applicability of the algorithm in comparison with the centralized, distributed and decentralized MPC schemes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

A novel moving window based adaptive unscented Kalman smoother (MW_AUKS) which adopts iterative correction strategy was proposed. This method gives consideration to both the steady-state detection accuracy and dynamic detection speed. The first objective is achieved by introducing a backward Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother to the forward unscented Kalman filter simultaneously. Based on the mean value of innovation within the window, whether sudden change of the state has happened is judged online. Then, state estimation covariance would be reset adaptively once the change is confirmed. Finally, multigroup simulations are conducted by means of a presented nonlinear state space estimation model. Results show that the new algorithm can effectively estimate the fundamental components, such as frequency, power angle and active/apparent power, and greatly speedup the rate of initial convergence. Meanwhile, accurate detection and rapid tracking of the state sudden change could be achieved. © 2015 Chin. Soc. for Elec. Eng.},

Compared with existing ideal and noise-resilient distributed methods, the proposed robust stochastic distributed secondary control method can achieve mean-square synchronisation for voltage and frequency restoration of distributed generations (DGs) along with the real power sharing accuracy through a sparse communication network, even though both the system measurement and communication channels are susceptible to noise interferences and limited band-width constraints. To this end, the graph theory, stochastic theory, and Kalman-filtering theory are employed to estimate the states of each DG based on the information of noisy measurement, and then the estimated signals are sent to the neighbour DGs via a noisy communication environment. The main advantages of the proposed method are its ability to provide the quality of the estimate, low complexity, low computational burden, and working even though both the system and communication channels are susceptible to noise interferences and limited band-width constraints. Finally, the simulation results in MATLAB/SimPowerSystems Toolbox show that the proposed method has better, robust, resilient, acceptable, and desirable performance compared with the recent and effective methods. © 2020 Institution of Engineering and Technology.

	abstract = {The computational complexity, area overhead and power consumption are the major drawbacks of Kalman filter that limits its use for various real-time applications including target tracking. This paper aims to optimize the Kalman algorithm to meet the growing demands of today’s tracking system. A reduced recursive scalar Kalman filter is proposed by simplifying the calculations of the posterior error co-variance estimate. This reduces the hardware cost and computational time. For hardware implementation, the architecture is divided into two parts. The first part calculates Kalman gain and posterior error co-variance estimate, and the second part calculates the output estimate. Both pipelining and parallel processing techniques are employed to increase the speed of computation. The area and power consumption are reduced by time sharing the architecture as the algorithm is recursive. The proposed technique is implemented on FPGA, and the performance of the Kalman filter is verified. The implementation requires nine adders, three subtractors, six multipliers and two dividers. A maximum operating frequency of 145 MHz is obtained with a worst case computational delay of seven clock cycles (6.881 ns). A parabolic path is used to verify the tracking performance of the architecture, and the simulation results show an accuracy loss of 1.98% between the actual and the estimated path. The architecture consumes a power of 0.128 W at 100 MHz. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2020.},

	abstract = {This study develops and compares several networked control and estimation algorithms to manipulate the power consumption of a population of residential thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs) to fulfill PJM frequency regulation requests given an imperfect communication network and modeling error. The algorithms rely on a model of the plant to reduce the effects of communication delays, and include a stochastic, predictive controller and two Kalman filter-based state estimation techniques. The first estimator uses a set of independent Kalman filters that run in parallel, and the second incorporates individual TCL models that rely on identified thermal parameters. We use simulations to examine 1) the algorithms' ability to adequately provide frequency regulation under a range of delay severities, and 2) the effect of increased modeling error. We find that both estimator-controller combinations provide acceptable frequency regulation with average delays of 20 s and minor modeling error. When we increase the modeling error by using a higher order model to represent the TCLs within the plant, the first estimator provides acceptable frequency regulation, whereas the second estimator provides poor frequency regulation. © 1969-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {A number of wave energy controllers tune the power take-off (PTO) system to the frequency of incident waves. Since real ocean waves are non-stationary by nature and not defined by a single frequency component, the PTO can be either tuned at a constant frequency characterized by the local spectrum or continuously tuned to a representative wave frequency. In either case, a time–frequency representation of the waves is expected since the wave profile changes over time. This paper discusses about the PTO tuning problem for passive and reactive controllers, in real waves, by comparing different methods for time-varying frequency estimation: the extended Kalman filter (EKF), frequency-locked loop (FLL), and Hilbert–Huang transform (HHT). The aim is to verify the impact of such methods on the absorbed and reactive powers, and the PTO rating. It is shown that the mean estimated frequency of the EKF and FLL, converges, respectively, to the mean centroid frequency and energy frequency, of the excitation force spectrum. Moreover, the HHT mean frequency has no correlation with the spectral statistical properties. A comparison of the energy absorbed shows that up to 37% more energy is obtained with the HHT over the other estimation methods. Numerical simulations are performed with sea elevation data from the Irish coast. © 2018 IEEE.},

For an RTO/ISO, actual net interchange could deviate from the scheduled one and the difference is called inadvertent interchange. Accurate forecasts of actual net interchange will enable RTOs or ISOs to minimize the amount of inadvertent interchange and consequently reduce operational costs. The task compared with load forecasting, is difficult because actual net interchange is volatile and there are a lot of relevant factors to be considered such as demand uncertainties and price differentials. In this paper, features of actual net interchange and relevant factors are explicitly examined to identify the key factors through spectral analysis and correlation analysis. Wavelet decomposition is applied to decompose the data into components at different frequencies. Neural networks are used to forecast each frequency component individually, and the results are then combined as the final forecasts. This method is compared with persistence and linear regression models to evaluate the performance. Numerical testing based on ISO New England and PJM's data shows that our method provides the best predictions. © 2014 IEEE.},

The transmission performance of the proposed two stage EKF has been verified through numerical simulations on polarization multiplexed (PM) 16-quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) system operating at 28 Gbaud. The results prove that the proposed technique is well tolerant towards the impairments of FO, linear and nonlinear phase noise and amplitude noise even up to ≈3000 km of standard single mode fiber (SSMF) transmission at a launch power of 3 dBm, giving a bit error rate (BER) of ≈2.4e-2 which is the 20% soft decision forward error correction (SD-FEC) threshold.

We prove that for a widesense stationary uncorrelated scattering channel in which P plane waves superpose at the receiver antenna, each current/future sample of the channel transfer function can be represented as a linear combination of at least P past channel transfer function samples. Based on this result, a vector auto-regressive model is used to model the dynamics of the time-varying mobile radio channel. The adaptive Kalman filter initially uses a state transition matrix derived from the Jakes' model for the temporal correlation and the one-sided exponential power delay profile for the spectral correlation between the channel transfer function samples. Afterwards, the state transition matrix of the adaptive Kalman filter is periodically updated by computing the correlation between the estimated channel transfer function samples. It is shown that the periodical update of the state transition matrix results in a significant prediction performance improvement over the one based on the correlation estimates using the Jakes' model and the one-sided exponential power delay profile. Furthermore, the proposed adaptive Kalman filter yields a satisfactory performance when used as an interpolation filter in the frequency domain even for cases where the channel transfer function is sampled at sub-Nyquist rate. © VDE Verlag GMBH · Berlin · Offenbach, Germany.},

The fan is in the process of yaw most of the time, which affects the utilization efficiency of wind energy and the service life of the yaw mechanism. In order to reduce the invalid yaw times of the wind turbine, a yaw control method combining the time series prophet model and Kalman filter is proposed. The fusion control method is to preprocess the wind direction with Kalman filter, and then predict the time series to double judge whether the motor is yaw, and integrate it into the yaw control system of wind turbine. Compared with different control methods, the analysis results effectively reduce the yaw frequency of the unit, so as to improve the service life of the yaw mechanism of the unit. It is proved that the fusion control method is effective. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a robust model-based active damping control in natural frame for a three-phase voltage source inverter with LCL filter. The presence of the LCL filter complicates the design of the control scheme, particularly when system parameters deviation is considered. The proposed control method is addressed to overcome such difficulties and uses a modified converter model in a state observer. In this proposal, the converter model is modified by introducing a virtual damping resistor. Then, a Kalman filter makes use of this model to estimate the system state-space variables. Although the state estimates do not obviously match the real world system variables, they permit designing three-current sliding-mode controllers that provide the following features to the closed loop system: 1) robust and active damping capability like in the case of using a physical damping resistor; 2) robustness because the control specifications are met independently of variation in the system parameters; 3) noise immunity due to the application of the Kalman filter; and 4) power loss minimization because the system losses caused by the physical damping resistor are avoided. An interesting side effect of the proposed control scheme is that the sliding surfaces for each controller are independent. This decoupling property for the three controllers allows using a fixed switching frequency algorithm that ensures perfect current control. To complete the control scheme, a theoretical stability analysis is developed. Finally, selected experimental results validate the proposed control strategy and permit illustrating all its appealing features. © 1986-2012 IEEE.},

Despite all of these significant advantages, their open communication architecture and connectivity renders the power systems' vulnerability to a range of cyberattacks. This article proposes a novel resilient control system for load frequency control (LFC) system under false data injection (FDI) attacks. It is common to use encryption in data transfer links as the first layer of defending mechanism; here, we propose a second defense layer that can jointly detect and mitigate FDI attacks on power systems. In this article, we propose a new anomaly detection technique that consists of a Luenberger observer and an artificial neural network (ANN). Since FDI attacks can happen rapidly, the observer structure is enhanced by the extended Kalman filter to improve the ANN ability for online detection and estimation. The resilient controller is designed based on the attack estimation, which can eliminate the need for control reconfiguration. The resiliency of the proposed design against FDI attacks is tested on the LFC system. The simulation results clearly show that the proposed control system can successfully detect anomalies and compensate for their adverse effects. © 1982-2012 IEEE.},

To gain appreciable success in the elimination of these two challenges, this paper advances a SR framework employing KF in the frequency domain, while no resort is made to any approximations or extra assumptions in the dynamic system modeling and statistical matrices. Generally, previous KF-based SR methods organized the system with huge-sized matrices in the spatial domain, following which they tried to reduce the system dimension using approximation and/or limitation on point spread function (PSF). In this study, first, several small-dimension dynamic systems are separately made in the frequency domain supporting space-invariant PSFs of an arbitrary form and size. Then, the acquired small-dimension KF estimators are applied rather than the traditional huge-dimension one. These will greatly reduce computational complexity, decrease storage requirements allowing parallel implementation as well. Furthermore, our proposed SR framework can be used to produce high resolution image of an expedient size, that is, a scalable SR. Experimental results with both simulated and real world sequences indicate that our proposed framework works more effectively than the other compared methods, especially in fine details restoration. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the generation of a reference current and voltage signal based on a Kalman filter is offered for a 3-phase 4wire UPQC (Unified Power Quality Conditioner). The performance of the UPQC is improved with source voltages that are distorted due to harmonic components. Despite harmonic and frequency variations, the Kalman filter is capable enough to determine the amplitude and the phase angle of load currents and source voltages. The calculation of the first state is sufficient to identify the fundamental components of the current, voltage and angle. Therefore, the Kalman state estimator is fast and simple. A Kalman based control strategy is proposed and implemented for a UPQC in a distribution system. The performance of the proposed control strategy is assessed for all possible source conditions with varying nonlinear and linear loads. The functioning of the proposed control algorithm with a UPQC is scrutinized and validated through simulations employing MATLAB/Simulink software. Using a FPGA SPATRAN 3A DSP board, the proposed algorithm is developed and implemented. A small-scale laboratory prototype is built to verify the simulation results. The stated control scheme for the UPQC reduces the following issues, voltage sags, voltage swells, harmonic distortions (voltage and current), unbalanced supply voltage and unbalanced power factor under dynamic and steady-state operating conditions. © 2018, Korean Institute of Power Electronics.

	abstract = {Synchronization is a challenging problem for wireless nodes, especially for applications demanding good synchronization accuracy over wide areas. In that case, the GPS is a valuable solution as the nodes can independently synchronize to UTC. However, the energy consumption of a GPS receiver (over 100 mW when switched on) is not sustainable on a wireless node. Therefore, in this work, we developed a synchronization scheme based on periodic extinctions of the GPS receiver. The goal is to study the GPS power switching effect on the synchronization accuracy. To do so, a node with dedicated timestamping hardware was designed. Two clock models were compared to predict the node time when the GPS is off and the impact of a Kalman filter, to remove the GPS noise, was evaluated. From experimental data, we show that the choice of the clock model depends on the accuracy needed and that the Kalman filter improves the estimation of the clock frequency for both models. In our design, the GPS can be off from 60% up to 95% of the time for mean synchronization errors of 20 ns to 420 ns, respectively. This work demonstrates that GPS power switching is an efficient solution to reduce energy costs while maintaining a high synchronization accuracy. © 2001-2012 IEEE.},

This paper proposes an optical current transformer signal processing method based on colored noise extended Kalman filter which can reduce the measurement error caused by colored noise and realize frequency tracking. The following two cases are considered: 1) the dynamic noise is colored noise; 2) the observation noise is colored noise. In these two cases, the corresponding formulas of the proposed method are analyzed and derived. Simulation results showed that the extended Kalman filtering method based on colored noise can effectively filter the colored noise, and the output waveform and output error obtained by this method are improved effectively. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.},

	abstract = {Synchronized data provide unprecedented opportunities for inferring voltage frequencies and rates of change of frequencies (ROCOFs) across the buses of a power system. Aligned to this goal, this work puts forth a novel framework for learning dynamics after small-signal disturbances by leveraging the tool of Gaussian processes (GPs). We extend results on inferring the input and output of a linear time-invariant system using GPs to the multi-input multi-output setup by exploiting power system swing dynamics. This physics-aware learning technique captures time derivatives in continuous time, accommodates data streams sampled potentially at different rates, and can cope with missing data and heterogeneous levels of accuracy. While Kalman filter-based approaches require knowing all system inputs, the proposed framework handles readings of system inputs, outputs, their derivatives, and combinations thereof on an arbitrary subset of buses. Relying on minimal system information, it further provides uncertainty quantification in addition to point estimates for dynamic grid signals. The required spatiotemporal covariances are obtained by exploring the statistical properties of approximate swing dynamics driven by ambient disturbances. Numerical tests verify that this technique can infer frequencies and ROCOFs at non-metered buses under (non)-ambient disturbances for a linearized dynamic model of the IEEE 300-bus benchmark.  © 2021 IEEE.},

A drill string built of thread-connected components is used to transfer mechanical energy from a drill rig on the surface to a drill bit at the bottom end. The lowest part of a drill string, which is called bottom-hole assembly (BHA), contains sophisticated sub-assemblies for process and trajectory control, formation evaluation, surface communication, power generation, and system diagnostics. The BHA can experience critical vibrations without indication further up to the string. These vibrations need to be closely monitored for process control, fatigue management, and design feedback. However, the number of sensors is too small to provide reliable indication of loads on all critical components of the drill string. Adding sensors to each component is currently neither economically nor technically viable. This paper presents an application of existing Kalman Filters, merging information from available sensors and dynamic models to obtain state estimates for all components of the BHA. The expected accuracy and limitations are discussed. The results of load extrapolation are confirmed by comparison with measurements proving the concept under inaccurately defined interaction with a downhole environment. © 2020 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

Implementation of controlled islanding at the appropriate time can prevent the power system from cascading failures, and thus large-area power outages can be avoided. Given the above background, a method to determine the optimal timing of controlled islanding is presented by utilizing data from the wide area measurement system (WAMS) concerned and combination prediction. Specifically, WAMS is employed to attain power angles and operating frequencies of generators in real time, and a combined linear prediction algorithm is used to forecast disturbed trajectories of generators, and hence the power system can be islanded before that operating frequencies of generators go beyond their limits. In this way, the emergency shutdown of generators can be avoided and the operation stability of each island after controlled islanding maintained. Moreover, a combined linear prediction algorithm is presented based on the well established auto-regressive moving-average (ARMA) algorithm and Kalman filter algorithm so as to achieve better prediction performance. Finally, the proposed method is demonstrated by the IEEE 39-bus test system. © 2018 State Power Economic Research Institute. All rights reserved.},

It is highly time-varying which leads to low-frequency voltage fluctuations in the system, called flicker. Static VAr compensator (SVC) is always used in EAF plants to compensate the reactive power and reduce voltage fluctuations. The reactive power calculation unit is one of the most important units in SVC control system. Since SVC can only compensate the fundamental component, the calculated reactive power should not be sensitive to other harmonics. On the other hand, since the reactive power changes every half cycle, its calculation should be fast enough to track the changes. Hence, a calculation method with minimum delay and lowest harmonic sensitivity should be utilised to achieve an effective compensation. Among different already proposed methods for calculation of reactive power, differential method has the lowest delay. However, it is very sensitive to harmonics. In this study, Kalman filter is used to extract the fundamental components of voltage and current with a little delay and then they are used as inputs for the differential method. The proposed method is evaluated using some simulation signals and practical records from several EAFs in Mobarekeh steel company in Esfahan - Iran. © 2016, The Institution of Engineering and Technology.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a fast and robust unscented Kalman filter based decentralized dynamic state estimator (DSE) for power system online monitoring and control. The proposed robust DSE is able to detect, identify, and suppress three types of outliers, namely the observation, innovation, and structural outliers. Observation outliers refer to the received PMU measurements providing unreliable metered values due to gross errors or cyber attacks; innovation outliers are typically caused by impulsive system process noise, whereas structural outliers are induced by incorrect parameters of the generators or its associated controllers, such as exciters and speed governors. To enable the fast estimation of generator states of large-scale power systems in a decentralized manner, two model decoupling approaches are presented and compared. It is shown that the generator decoupling approach presented in this paper achieves higher statistical efficiency than the ones proposed in the literature in the presence of both small and large measurement noise. To detect and distinguish three types of outliers, projection statistics based multiple hypothesis testing approach is proposed. Specifically, three hypotheses corresponding to the occurrence of three types of outliers are assumed by constructing three innovation matrices; these matrices are made up by time-correlated innovation vectors, and/or predicted states, and/or measurements; then projection statistics are applied to each of the innovation matrix and its calculated projection values are checked by a statistical test to validate the assumed hypothesis. The identified outliers are further suppressed by a generalized maximum-likelihood-type estimator. Numerical results carried out on the IEEE 39-bus system demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. © 1969-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Lithium battery energy storage system (ESS) has fast response speed, but it is in service for a long time. Therefore, in the research of secondary frequency regulation, it is necessary to establish a battery model that can reflect the short-term polarization and estimate SOC accurately under long-term service. Therefore, we propose a method of variable parameter loss model of lithium battery suitable for secondary frequency modulation of power system and optimize its control strategy based on the relationship between the independent variable SOC and the internal electrical parameters of the battery. Firstly, we discretize the state equation of single cell to obtain the PNGV model with variable parameters. Then the SOC estimation method is improved by using the modified extended Kalman filter method. Finally, we did an analysis about the economy of the ESS participating in secondary frequency regulation by using the loss model, and the optimal control strategy is designed. The HPPC experiment of the ESS unit is designed by Simulink, and the accuracy of the simulation and experimental curves has been analyzed. Finally, the economic differences between the traditional control strategy and the optimal control strategy considering loss are compared. The results show that the error of the variable parameter model in the fitting experiment is no more than 0.41%, and the accuracy of SOC estimation is 12.96% higher than that of the traditional estimation. The economy of the optimized control strategy is 15.38% higher than that of the traditional control strategy. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved.},

However, due to the vulnerability of GNSS signal reception, the application of the GNSS SF-RTK/INS integration is limited in complex environments. To improve the positioning accuracy of SF-RTK/INS integration in GNSS-blocked environments, we present a low-cost tight integration system based on BDS/GPS SF-RTK, a low-cost inertial measurement unit (IMU), and a monocular camera. In such a system, a multi-state constraint Kalman filter (MSCKF) is adopted to integrate the single-frequency pseudo-range, phase-carrier, inertial measurements, and visual data tightly. A wheel robot dataset collected under satellite signal-blocked conditions is used to evaluate its performance in terms of position, attitude, and run time, respectively. Results illustrated that the presented model can provide higher position accuracy compared to those provided by the RTK/INS tight integration system and visual-inertial tight integration system. Moreover, the average running time presents the potential of the presented method in real-time applications. © 2023 by the authors.},

Instead of directly analyzing in abc coordinate frame, the symmetrical component transformation is employed to separate the positive, negative, and zero sequence networks. By using Clarke's transformation, the sequence networks are then transformed into the αβ stationary coordinate frame, and the number of system state variables is reduced to five. A novel Fault Tolerant Extended Kalman Filter real time estimation framework is proposed for power grid system synchronization with bad data measurements. Computer simulation studies show that the novel Fault Tolerant Extended Kalman Filter (FTEKF) provides more accurate results in voltage synchronization, comparing with the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). The proposed approach has been implemented with dSPACE and CompactRIO hardware in real-time. Our results have shown the potential applications of FTEKF in the future smart power grid synchronization. © 2016 American Automatic Control Council (AACC).},

	abstract = {Automated event detection and classification are vital to power system monitoring. This article proposes a novel event detection and classification scheme based on wide area frequency measurement system (WAFMS). Raw frequency measurements obtained from WAFMS are used as the only input to the event detection and classification algorithm (EDCA). Wavelet-based signal pre-processing is used to denoise the data. Afterward, the rate of change of frequency (ROCOF) is estimated from the frequency measurements using the Kalman filter (KF). In the same step, phase angle difference (PAD) across different stations is estimated using WAFMS. Thus, the overall algorithm uses three features such as frequency, ROCOF, and PAD to detect and classify events in the power system. In the first step, an event is detected based on standard deviation (SD) of estimated ROCOF and PAD. In the second step, four types of events are classified using wide area frequency measurements. The suggested algorithms have been validated with real WAFMS data from the Indian Power System, recent 9th August 2019 U.K. blackout data collected from the U.K. power system, and 20th July 2017 oscillation event data obtained from ISO New England (ISO-NE) power system. As a promising tool for power system monitoring, the suggested scheme requires less input measurement for decision making and is having a low computational complexity, which is suitable for practical application. © 2010-2012 IEEE.},

There are multiple conventional and recent advanced frequency regulation techniques to dissolve this issue. The existing techniques using conventional controllers in microgrid control are well suited for voltage regulation, but the frequency cannot be adequately controlled using conventional and linear controllers. Most of the advanced control methods use algorithms to manage the grid frequency stability. This review comprehensively discusses the advanced control techniques for frequency regulation in micro-grids namely model predictive control, adaptive control, sliding mode control, h-infinity control, back-stepping control, (Disturbance estimation technique) kalman state estimator-based strategies, and intelligent control methods. Each control method is briefly explained along with recent advancements and corresponding governing equations.

Robust and accurate estimation algorithms are required to improve the knowledge of the current sea state on a wave-to-wave basis in order to ensure power harvesting as close as possible to optimal behavior. In this paper, we present a simple but innovative approach for estimating the wave force dominant frequency and wave force dominant amplitude based on the unscented Kalman filter.

	abstract = {The two main techniques for Global Positioning System (GPS) attitude measurement are to use GPS carrier phase and signal power, but the measurement information is single and independent. Aimed at the problem of attitude measurement of a spinning vehicle, a roll angle estimation method using GPS based on adaptive filter is proposed, which measures the roll angle and roll angular velocity by combining signal power and Doppler frequency information of GPS receiver antenna. The system model of the roll angle and roll angular velocity measurement is established by using the current statistical model, the measurements are selected according to the predicted estimation value of the roll angle, and an adaptive filter is proposed. The adaptive filter algorithm of roll angular acceleration estimation is used to realize the adaptive adjustment of the variance matrix of the system noise, which avoids the selection of the roll angle acceleration maximum value and reduces the effect of noise. The feasibility of the roll angle estimation method using GPS based on adaptive filter is verified by simulation, and the results show that the measurement accuracy of the method is higher than that of Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). © 2020, Editorial Board of JBUAA.

	abstract = {For uncontrolled power caused by wind conditions and external environmental conditions, battery packs are a type of energy storage system commonly used in wind power generation systems to smooth power fluctuations. The traditional cogeneration scheduling method not only relies on thermal energy storage devices but also frequently starts micro gas turbines, which affects the service life of the equipment. This paper proposes a dispatching method for a wind power system based on cogeneration. The wind power generation system adds an electrolytic cell (EL) and a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) to absorb long-term fluctuations, and the battery absorbs short-term fluctuations, and relies on the extended Kalman particle filter algorithm for scheduling. ELs and PEMFCs can not only balance fluctuations from wind and thermal energy systems, eliminate the need for thermal energy storage devices, but also correct the start-stop frequency of micro gas turbines. The algorithm will also be applied to the state of charge estimation of the battery to improve the accuracy of the estimation. Simulation analysis shows that the grid-connected active power fluctuation decreases from ±500 to ±200 kW, and the system's correction effect is analyzed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

Then, a novel method to simultaneously estimate the power imbalance and the system inertia constant is developed. According to an analytical basis, a base system is selected from a set of pre-defined base systems to guarantee accurate power imbalance estimation. Finally, a mathematical index is investigated to calculate a threshold for the generation-load power imbalance beyond which loads should be shed. Further, a systematic approach for specifying the amount of load to be shed in each transmission bus of the system is proposed.

A first-order resistor-capacitor (RC) equivalent-circuit model is put forward, capable of representing the LTO cell's impedance magnitude with an error of less than 0.1 mΩ. Thereafter, the performance of the proposed one-RC model structure for online SOC estimation is experimentally verified using the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF).

	abstract = {During the radio-off periods of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) node, the timer Interrupt ReQuest (IRQ) which used to maintain the system clock become an important energy consumption source of Micro Controller Unit (MCU), thus the IRQ frequency has a great influence on WSN node total energy consumption. A timer resolution adjustment method based on Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) approach is proposed, which switches high and low IRQ frequencies according to the characteristics of the protocol. Being at a low frequency during sleep period, if a node needs to switch to wake-up period, it will first obtain the optimal estimation of the start time of high resolution timing period by UKF, then enter the high resolution timing period after a linear combination of a group of gradual-changing resolution timer IRQ. The simulations of ContikiMAC protocol on the Tmote platform are conducted.

	abstract = {When a radar equipped on an approaching vehicle transmits a signal whose frequency band overlaps with our own radar system, mutual interference problems arise. When mutual interference occurs, the target detection performance is degraded because the target signals are masked by the high power of direct interference signals. Therefore, we propose a signal processing technique to restore signals distorted by mutual interference in an automotive radar system to increase the reliability of target detection. First, since it is necessary to recognize the period where the interference occurred, a method to find the period of interference based on peak detection is presented. Then, the Kalman filter is employed to recover the distorted signal in the interference region by using the undistorted portion of the signal as its input. In simulations using two frequency modulated continuous wave radar systems, the influence of interference was effectively mitigated with our proposed method and target information was correctly estimated. © 2020 IEEE},

The Extended Kalman filter (EKF) is a suitable estimator for such dynamics, but its implementation tends to be complex and possibly unstable when tracking high-dimensional graph signals. To tackle this, we propose the graph signal processing (GSP)-EKF, which replaces the Kalman gain in the EKF with a graph filter that aims to minimize the computed prediction error. The resulting structure of the GSP-EKF Kalman gain increases the numerical stability and reduces the computational burden compared with the standard EKF, particularly when dealing with bandlimited graph processes. We show that for a measurement model with orthogonal graph frequencies, the GSP-EKF coincides with the EKF. The GSP-EKF is evaluated for graph signal tracking in power system state estimation. It is shown that in this case, the proposed GSP-EKF 1) attains the EKF under the accurate model; and 2) outperforms the EKF under a model mismatch, while being notably less complex in both cases. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The rapid development of new energy fields such as electric vehicles and smart grids has put forward higher requirements for the power management of battery integrated systems. Considering that internal temperature and parameter consistency are important factors affecting battery safety and state estimation accuracy, a lumped thermoelectric coupling model based on the multi-time scale effects of battery dynamics parameter is established in this paper. On this basis, a new multi-feature separation modeling idea is proposed and adopted to complete the development of the strong coupling adaptive asynchronous identification strategy to realize the solution of the model. Specifically, the high-frequency and low-frequency characteristics of the resistor–capacitor link under different time constants are distinguished on different time scales. Three sub-filters based on forgetting factor recursive least squares, extended Kalman filtering and joint Kalman filtering are used to realize the adaptive asynchronous synergistic estimation of battery high-frequency dynamics parameter, low-frequency dynamics parameter and internal temperature. In addition, the filters at different time scales are strongly coupled through the voltage response on the diffusion impedance, and the time scale drive under slow dynamics depends on the current distribution of the test conditions. The experimental results of two long-term cycles show that the proposed strategy exhibits excellent terminal voltage tracking effect and internal temperature estimation accuracy. Finally, the concept of parameter dispersion is proposed and discussed.

	abstract = {In the last years, large-scale deployment of renewable energy sources has led to the use of significant shares of generation from intermittent sources. Renewable energy sources units are notably inverter-connected wind turbines and photovoltaic that as such do not provide rotational inertia: this has implications for frequency dynamics and power system stability and operation. Frequency dynamics are faster in case of systems with low rotational inertia, thus making frequency control and power system operation more challenging. While the impact of low rotational inertia on power system stability and operation have been widely investigated in the recent literature, in this paper a new Bayesian statistical inference approach is proposed for the on-line estimation of the rotational inertia of a given system. The need for estimation is based upon the observation that the amount of renewable energy affecting the system is a random process. The authors' researches of this paper is devoted to the Bayesian on-line recursive estimation of the amount of the so-called 'Renewable Energy Source Share'. The numerical application reported in the companion paper [1] confirms that the proposed estimation technique constitutes a very fast, efficient and, especially, a robust method for 'tracking' the above share in view of an efficient assessment of rotational inertia. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we suppose an underwater optical wireless communication (UOWC) system, where the communication utilizes visible light communication for its advantages as wide spectrum, high data rate and high accuracy. The novelty of this paper is focused on improving the channel estimation between transmitter and receiver, where using Kalman Filter (KF) for channel estimation in UOWCs achieves the best results as compared to other traditional channel estimation methods. The scenario of this paper is summarized in transmitting data from transmitter to receiver via underwater harbor and coastal channels. Two channel models are utilized: weighted double gamma functions (WDGF) and a combination of exponential and arbitrary power function (CEAPF). The modulation technique used is optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing with two kinds: direct current optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DCO-OFDM) and asymmetrically clipping optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (ACO-OFDM). Three different techniques are used for channel estimation: Least Square (LS), minimum mean square error (MMSE), and KF. The simulation results reveal that the ACO-OFDM modulation technique with CEAPF channel modeling using KF achieves the lowest bit error rate (BER) compared to other channel estimation methods. The improvement percentage at BER = 10−1 is 13.3% for ACO-OFDM over DCO-OFDM with CEAPF in coastal water and is is 9.3% for WDGF. This indicates that CEAPF performs about 4% better than WDGF for ACO-OFDM than DCO-OFDM in terms of channel estimation. © 2023, The Author(s).},

The veracity of data increases with respect to time and becomes a challenging task for data managers. For managing large data sets, preprocessing is a fundamental part of the data management system, and often it is called Intelligent Compression (IC). IC is a method for removing redundant or repeated data from a disk or any other storage device. In this paper, various filtering techniques are used to compress and preprocess large data set of power consumption in SG. Filtering eliminates abnormal or unwanted components, signals, or features from a data set. Here, five filtering techniques have been used as Butterworth, Smoothing, Kalman, Frequency swept, and Filtfilt with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to predict Power Consumption in the Smart Grid. The results are compared with different evaluation metrics for five different datasets. It is found that Filtfilt filtering techniques with LSTM provide better performance and accuracy over other filtering techniques. © 2023 IETE.},

The proposed method is implemented and verified in the PDM-QPSK system and the PDM-16QAM system with the comparisons to conventional improved Mth-power (IMP) algorithm for CFO estimation, blind phase search (BPS) algorithm or Viterbi-Viterbi (V-V) algorithm for CPN recovery. It is demonstrated that the proposed scheme shows high CFO estimation accuracy, with absolute mean estimation error below 1.5 MHz. Meanwhile, the proposed method has the CFO tolerance of [±3 GHz] for PDM-QPSK system and [±0.9 GHz] for PDM-16QAM system.

Accurate characterization of voltage variations relies much on the precise identification of frequencies of the measured signals. Although the Prony's method can provide high resolution for frequency estimation, the computational burden in the root-finding process is a crucial problem. A modified Prony-based solution procedure for voltage variation tracking is proposed in this paper. By providing a set of filters, the transfer polynomial with high estimation order in Prony's model can be efficiently reduced. The performance of the proposed method is validated by testing the generated and actual measured voltage signals. Results are compared with those obtained by typical Prony's method, namely, fast Fourier transform, adaptive linear neural network, and Kalman filtering. It shows that the proposed method is more accurate regardless of interferences of the power system frequency deviation, harmonics, and interharmonics, where both voltage variations and harmonics can be simultaneously detected. © 1982-2012 IEEE.},

The control scheme simplified SSLKF (Steady State Linear Kalman Filter) based FLL (Frequency Locked Loop) obtains the fundamental grid voltages component. The voltage across the capacitor called DC link voltage, is regulated by VSC at a desired value. The extracted solar PV power is delivered to load as well as to grid. An experimental prototype is setup to test the AWILOG based control algorithm. Test results show satisfactory responses under load unbalancing condition and changing solar irradiation levels.

	abstract = {This paper proposes a decentralized method for estimation of dynamic states of a power system. The method remains robust to time-synchronization errors and high noise levels in measurements. Robustness of the method has been achieved by incorporating internal angle in the dynamic model used for estimation and by decoupling the estimation process into two stages with continuous updation of measurement-noise variances. Additionally, the proposed estimation method does not need measurements obtained from phasor measurement units; instead, it just requires analog measurements of voltages and currents directly acquired from instrument transformers. This is achieved through statistical signal processing of analog voltages and currents to obtain their magnitudes and frequencies, followed by application of unscented Kalman filtering for nonlinear estimation. The robustness and feasibility of the method have been demonstrated on a benchmark power system model. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The present paper investigates the effective application of phasor measurement units (PMUs) with different technologies and filtering dynamics to the design of wide-area power system stabilizer (WAPSS). Two frequency-adaptive PMU algorithms shown to exceed the C37.118 class-M requirements based on FIR- and Kalman-bandpass filtering are selected for study. Their sharp dynamic differences are characterized using accurate fourth-order transfer functions derived from step responses using system identification techniques. While FIR-based PMUs have no overshoot in their phase and amplitude step responses, the adaptive Kalman filter allows for better out-of-band interference rejection at the cost of a phase step response with overshoot and a higher computational burden. These PMUs are implemented in Simulink and then embedded in electro-magnetic transients (EMT) simulations to experiment the realistic WAPSS behavior with the discrete-time devices in the loop. It is shown that WAPSSs with optimized settings can improve the damping performance of EMT models of a test system and a simplified Hydro-Québec network including PMU filtering dynamics and transmission delays. However, WAPSSs based on EKF-PMUs yielded better performances, thanks to their shorter group delay compared with FIR-PMUs. PMU devices and algorithms meeting standard C37-118 can thus behave quite differently under stressed dynamics. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Modern infrastructure and a myriad of services rely on positioning and timing information provided by Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and in particular the Global Positioning System (GPS). However, given their low received signal power levels, GNSS signals are vulnerable to Radio Frequency Interference (RFI), either from non-intentional or intentional (jamming), sources. Hence, GNSS itself has become a critical infrastructure which must be protected. Since RFI source is unknown a priori, passive localization systems consisting of spatially distributed Sensor Nodes (SNs) are needed to geo-locate the RFI. These systems typically use source Angle of Arrival (AOA), Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) or a combination of AOA/TDOA measurements which are non-linear in nature, to estimate the RFI position. Also, dynamics associated with the RFI source(s) further complicates the geo-localization process. This paper explores and reports on the use of various Kalman Filters in combining AOA and TDOA measurements for efficient geo-localization and tracking of dynamic and stationary RFI sources based on real measurements from one such geo-localization system. We report on and contrast the geo-localization accuracies and computational complexities of the Extended, Unscented and Single Propagation Unscented Kalman Filters along with the traditional snap-shot approach. © 2020 IEEE.},

Any faults occur in the MG can cause deviations on the voltage, frequency and voltage sag/swell, which affects the power quality. In order to overcome these issues in this paper we proposed to design an adaptive model predictive control (MPC)-based robust extended Kalman filter (REKF) with improved particle swarm optimised selective harmonic elimination (IPSO-SHE) control system. This fetches the importance of power quality improvement. The utilisation of adaptive MPC with robust EKF express the harmonic signatures produced in the system which can be used to detect islanding. An IPSO-SHE is finally employed to reduce the harmonics which significantly improves the quality of power delivered to the load. Our proposed control system has been implemented in the working platform of MATLAB/Simulink and tested with certain load conditions. The simulation results of the proposed control system and comparison with existing control systems shows the significance of the proposed work. Copyright © 2021 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

Smart grids offer a platform which provides an efficient way of transmission, quicker-restoration, reduces the operational cost and peak demand of a system, thereby resulting in better integration and improved form of security. The phasor measurement unit (PMU) plays a very significant role in smart grid technology, where it contributes to measuring the synchro phasors, thus making it valuable to dynamically monitor different types of transient processes occurring in a system. The parameter estimation of PMU measures the frequency change by taking the difference of two successive frequencies that may worsen the quality of noise. However, in this paper, proposed work is done on PMU-parameter estimation by using an extended version of the Kalman filter along with the optimization techniques. The proposed algorithm of the Kalman filter used in the process helps in predicting the states of noise and covariance. Further, the optimization of the generated output is done using an intelligent PSO technique. The experimental analysis indicates that the results obtained from PSO-optimized Kalman filter are more effective than the considered existing approaches. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {Distributed Kalman filtering and the local statistical approach to fault diagnosis are used to develop a systematic method for the detection of attacks against sensors of the power grid. To treat the case of grid's frequency may deviation from its nominal value as well as the case of imprecise grid frequency measurement (i) the sensors dynamics is described using multiple local Kalman filters associated with different measurements of the grid's frequency, and (ii) fusion of the local filters' estimates is performed, in the sense of distributed Kalman filtering, so as to obtain a reliable aggregate estimate of the sensors' state. Next, to emulate the functioning of the grid's sensors in the fault-free mode, the distributed Kalman filter is used as a virtual sensor. By comparing the output of the distributed Kalman filter against the output of the real sensors, the resulting differences generate the residuals' vector. The residuals sequence undergoes statistical signal processing, so as to determine if specific sensors have undergone an intruder;s attack. The generalized likelihood ratio of the residuals sequence is used, as a statistical change detection criterion. This provides a statistical test that is based on the χ distribution, and allows to detect deviation of the sensors' functioning from normal mode. Using the properties of the χ distribution, an optimal threshold is defined for deciding on whether a sensor has been providing distorted measurements or not. Besides, with the application of this statistical criterion to clusters of sensors within the entire sensors' set it is possible to isolate those particular sensors which have been exposed to failure or an intruder's attack. The method achieves detection of sensors' malfunctioning that differs less than 1% from the nominal sensor's output. The application of the proposed method contributes to the enforcement of the security levels of the electric power grid. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {A novel control method combining nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) with linear kalman filter (LKF) and adaptive notch filter (ANF) for an integrated helicopter/engine system with variable rotor speed is proposed to enhance the response ability of turboshaft engine. Firstly, based on the integrated helicopter/engine model with variable rotor speed, an ANF combined with frequency estimation is introduced. Then, in order to estimate the significant and unmeasurable performance parameters utilized in model predictive control, such as temperature before turbine, a nonlinear model predictive controller based on LKF is presented. The simulation verifications demonstrate that the fundamental frequency of torsional vibration changes from 1.30Hz to 2.70Hz when the rotor speed varies continuously by 50%. In this case, compared with the notch filter, all torsional vibration amplitudes are damped below 0.1% by ANF. Meanwhile, in comparison with the PID controller, the NMPC can reduce the overshoot and droop of the power turbine speed to less than 1% with steady-state error no more than 0.5% at the off-design point of NMPC based on adaptive torsional vibration suppression. The applications of LKF and similar transformation improve the control accuracy and robustness performance of the NMPC designed at a single operating point.  © 2019 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.},

Inaccurate dynamic power plant models may affect the operation and planning of power systems. Hence, keeping the model updated is crucial. Traditionally, dynamic models of power plants are calibrated by offline staged tests. Recently, PMU based remote calibration techniques are developed in attempt to calibrating the dynamic models remotely and reducing the frequency of offline calibration. This paper presents the implementation of PMU based dynamic model calibration of Type-4 Wind Turbine Generators by using the Ensemble Kalman Filter.

	abstract = {A model predictive controller (MPC) for load frequency control (LFC) of an interconnected power system is investigated. The MPC is based on a simplified system model of the Nordic power system, and it takes into account limitations on tie-line power flow, generation capacity, and generation rate of change. The participation factors for each generator are optimization variables, and suggestions are made as to how one can ensure tie-line power transfer margins through slack-variables, and pricing information through the objective function. The solution of MPC for LFC is completed by including a Kalman filter for state estimation. The presented MPC is compared against a conventional LFC/AGC scheme with proportional integral (PI) controllers. Simulations show that the MPC gives better frequency response while using cheaper resources. This paper illustrates that MPC could be a realistic solution to some of the LFC problems power systems are facing today. © 2015 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In the past two decades, much research and industry effort has been dedicated to transportation electrification. In particular, aerospace industry, with the more electric aircraft (MEA) revolution, is shifting toward the usage of electrical in place of mechanical energy on board to save fossil fuel and reduce polluting emissions. For this reason, phase-locked loops (PLLs) systems have been well developed for synchronizing different power sources and loads within the aircraft electrical grid. Since one of the proposed solutions for MEA power grids is to operate at variable frequency from 360 to 800 Hz, a third-order model-based steady-state linear Kalman filter PLL (SSLKF-PLL) has been proposed in the literature to achieve fast tracking performance during such grid frequency variations. To suppress the potential disturbances due to harmonics in the grid, sensor scaling errors/unbalances, and dc offsets while maintaining low computational burden, this article aims to enhance the disturbance rejection ability of SSLKF-PLL by adding a repetitive observer (RO). Simulation and experimental tests show that RO allows stable and effective suppression of disturbances from all the abovementioned sources during variable frequency operation. The execution time of the proposed PLL is only 4.23 μs using a Xilinx Zynq-7000-based platform, where the added RO takes 2.664 μs to execute, and the SSLKF-PLL alone takes 1.566 μs. © 1972-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a new proposal for the implementation of the well-known direct power control (DPC) technique in grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) systems is suggested. Normally, the DPC is executed using a look-up table procedure based on the error between the actual and reference values of the active and reactive power. Thus, the structure of the DPC is simple and results in a fast transient behavior of the inner current loop (injected currents). Therefore, in the current study, the DPC is reformulated using a dead-beat function. In this formulation, the reference voltage vector (RVV) is obtained in the α-β reference frame. Consequently, the switching states for the inverter can be obtained based on the sign of the components of the RVV. The suggested DPC is compared with the conventional one and other switching tables, which are intended for performance enhancement. Furthermore, an extended Kalman filter (EKF) is utilized to eliminate all grid-voltage sensors. Moreover, the switching frequency of the proposed technique is minimized without any need for weighting factors or cost function evaluation. The overall control technique is validated using a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experimental set-up and compared with other schemes under different operating conditions.  © 2013 State Grid Electric Power Research Institute.},

The sensitive range of angle measurement is expanded to 360° through a proper arrangement of the accelerometers. The dynamic performance of the measurement system is characterized on a standard vibrating table with a different excitation. Measurement error is reduced by using Kalman filtering algorithm and the data fusion technique. It was found that the tilt error rotating around a circle is 0.9° under the sine excitation at a frequency of 20Hz and a peak acceleration of 0.2g, while tilt error rotating around a circle is 0.43° under the random excitation condition that the excitation frequency range is from 20 to 100 Hz, the effective acceleration is 8.94982 m/s2 and power spectrum density 1 (m/s^2)/ √ Hz. The minimum resolution is found to be 0.03° by the tilt sensor under the random excitation with a peak value is 0.8g and the vibration frequency is 25Hz. The minimum resolution of the measurement system has a tendency to become worse when the vibration intensity becomes higher. © 2016 IEEE.},

The design of KF-damping controller is based on the magnitude of damping torque in the range of torsional mode frequencies. We apply the genetic algorithm to optimize the controller parameters.

	abstract = {Geolocation is an important topic nowadays. Among other applications, geolocation can be used by frequency regulators to monitor the time, frequency and space domain. In this case of a passive geolocation system, Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) is often used. In this paper we analyze a geolocation system based on a combination of TDOA and Received Signal Strength Differences (RSSD). The benefit of combining the two measurement types is shown using the Cramer Rao Lower Bound (CRLB). The suitability of the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) as an algorithm for the hybrid geolocation system is investigated. Simulation results show that by using the UKF, the instability of RSSD geolocation, that is often caused by bad geometry, is compensated.

	abstract = {This paper proposes fully decentralized l1 optimal dynamic state estimators (DSEs) for load frequency control (LFC) of interconnected power generating systems and provides its comparative and extensive study with respect to three other types of DSEs. To this end, we present the dynamic model of a single area of the power-generating unit occurring from the interconnected power systems. By noting the fact that each area is affected by the frequency deviations in other areas, and it is quite difficult to obtain any property of the load changes in power systems, we characterize the disturbances in the LFC of power systems as bounded persistent signals. As a candidate for DSEs for LFC of power systems, the unknown input observer (UIO), Kalman filter (KF), and H∞ optimal DSE are considered, and their limitations are analyzed in depth. In connection with this, the l1 optimal DSE, in which the maximum magnitude of estimation error for the worst bounded persistent disturbances is minimized, is proposed as the most effective state estimator. Finally, the practical validity and effectiveness of the proposed l1 optimal DSE are demonstrated through some comparative simulations for a three-area power generating system.  © 2013 IEEE.},

The control scheme is based on H∞ and linear quadratic Gaussian techniques. The main idea of the control design is to be stable against the parameter’s uncertainties and the load disturbance. A complete model of the power system with the DFIG has been linearized. This model has been utilized to design both controllers of H∞ and linear quadratic Gaussian. The H∞ is designed by optimal selecting of the weighting functions to ensure the robustness and to enhance the overall performance. Also, the full states considering the frequency deviation are assessed based on the standard Kalman filter method. Moreover, the states of the system are applied with the linear quadratic Gaussian feedback optimal control performance under normal and abnormal operating conditions. Simulation tests are applied with the purpose of validation of the overall controllers’ performance.

	abstract = {The fluctuation in contact force between the pantograph and the catenary severely affects the current collection quality of electric multiple units in high-speed railway. In particular, when double pantographs operate simultaneously, the contact force on trailing pantograph (TP) fluctuates violently due to the passage of leading pantograph (LP). To address this problem, a prior-information-based finite-frequency textH ∞controller, incorporating an adaptive estimator, is proposed for the active control of double pantographs in this paper. As the prior information is of great importance, the frequency characteristics of contact force are analyzed based on power spectrum density and utilized in calculating the control gain matrix. The finite-frequency control is employed to decrease the contact force fluctuation within the concerned frequency range with limited control force. Considering the unknown and time-varying noise statistic, an adaptive cubature Kalman filter is presented to estimate the states of pantographs. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed control strategy are evaluated with implementations in a nonlinear double-pantograph-catenary system model under different operational conditions. The results show that, for both LP and TP, the control strategy can adequately decrease the contact force fluctuation. Particularly, it has a good capability to reject parameter perturbations and external disturbance. © 1967-2012 IEEE.},

The uplink-downlink transformation shall be performed at the base station by exploiting the current uplink and delayed downlink measurements. Based on a physically motivated geometric channel model, where different plane waves are assumed to superpose at the receiver antenna, the uplink-downlink transformation problem is shown to be a linear estimation problem. We propose a Kalman filter based uplink-downlink transformation algorithm. Commonly, the parameters of the Kalman filter, e.g., the state transition matrix, are obtained by using the channel autocorrelation matrix from stochastic channel models, e.g., the Jakes' fading model with truncated one-sided exponential power delay profile. However, the stochastic process for many channels of interest is not ergodic. Thus these stochastic channel models do not describe the statistics for a single realization. We thus propose to use these stochastic channel models for initialization only and then to periodically update the parameters of the Kalman filter by using the estimated channel coefficients. This results in an adaptive Kalman filter based uplink-downlink transformation algorithm. Performance of the proposed algorithm is assessed using Monte Carlo simulations. © 2015 IEEE.},

The higher-order TKF can not only adapt to the small frequency deviation condition but also prevents certain harmonics leakage. It has been increasingly widely applied in power grid synchronization and other power system fields. However, to the best of authors' knowledge, systematical analyses of the impact of different models on the estimation performance and the methods for extraction of the shifted grid frequency have not been reported to date. The aim of this paper is to examine the TKF-based phase estimation algorithms (PEA) with regard to aspects such as the steady state, dynamic state and computational cost. Comparisons were carried out to evaluate the effects of the model and the order of TKF on the dynamic response and steady-state error. A strong tracking algorithm was also introduced to enhance the dynamic response. Several approaches for reducing the computational burden are given. Finally, combined with the moving average filter (MAF), which is a typical low-pass filter, an application example of TKF-based PEA was developed, and its performance was verified by experiments. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In modern systems, many well-known techniques (e.g., dynamic voltage and frequency scaling, job scheduling etc.) have been developed to achieve low power, high performance, appropriate quality-of-service or other specific purposes. Workload prediction is an extremely critical factor for bringing these techniques into full play. However, it is very difficult to accurately predict the workloads of upcoming tasks if they are varying drastically. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid fuzzy-Kalman filter and the corresponding area-efficient hardware architecture to accurately and quickly predict the workload with large variation. To decrease the hardware complexity while maintaining sufficient accuracy, the computation of Kalman Gain is simplified with a lookup table method. In addition, the workload and covariance values in Kalman filter are properly normalized and truncated to significantly reduce the bit length of hybrid workload predictor. Furthermore, a simplified fuzzy controller is developed to adaptively adjust the measurement noise covariance of Kalman filter so that the prediction error can be further lowered. Experimental results of real applications exhibit that the proposed hybrid fuzzy-Kalman filter can achieve lower prediction error and smaller hardware area when compared to previous workload predictors. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

	abstract = {The problem of optimal state estimation via deterministic Kalman filtering in the time and in the frequency domains is considered. The frequency domain method based on spectral factorization, which was developed previously for linear quadratic optimal control, is extended here to Kalman filtering. For a class of Riesz-spectral systems, it is shown that the spectral factorization problem can be solved by symmetric extraction of poles and zeros, which leads to a tractable computational method in order to calculate the optimal output injection in the Kalman filter problem. Then the class of Sturm–Liouville operators is considered on the space of square integrable functions on a finite interval. According to the properties of such unbounded operators on that space, a set of interpolation Hilbert spaces is considered in a second time. Properties of Sturm–Liouville operators on these spaces are exhibited, together with properties of the C0−semigroups that are generated by these operators. In addition, a characterization of approximate observability by means of point measurement operators is established for such systems. For the aforementioned Sturm–Liouville systems with pointwise measurement, the assumptions needed for applying the symmetric extraction method are shown to be satisfied, which entails that these systems are well-adapted for Kalman filtering with a pointwise measurement observation operator which is bounded on a well-chosen Hilbert state space. The great advantage of considering a new state space is pushed forward by this optimal state estimation problem, which would not make sense in the space of square integrable functions, notably in terms of Riccati equation. The main results are applied to the Kalman filtering of a diffusion system with mixed boundary conditions and pointwise measurement. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Accurate lithium-ion battery state of charge (SOC) estimation can enhance reliable and safe operation of electric vehicles. A thermal coupling simplified first-principles model has been adopted to achieve high SOC estimation accuracy. Extended Kalman filter and adaptive extended Kalman filter algorithms are separately combined with the model to estimate state of charge for a wide range of environmental temperatures (10–45 °C) and different charge/discharge rates. The SOC estimation method is validated with respect to the accuracy and convergence. The average absolute errors using the adaptive extended Kalman filter algorithm under conditions of dynamic stress tests and hybrid pulse power characteristics are less than 1%, which is 1.5% smaller than that of the EKF algorithm. Compared to the extended Kalman filter algorithm, the adaptive extended Kalman filter algorithm can achieve fast convergence after less than 10 s while maintaining the estimation accuracy given an initial SOC guess error of 50%. The effects of sampling frequency and battery aging states on estimation accuracy are also assessed. A sampling frequency of at least 1 Hz can ensure the accuracy is within 1%. The developed SOC estimation method is also fit for the degraded battery with about 1% estimation error. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

One important newly rising application of such error characterization is also in cyber-attack detection. This work outlines how the estimation error set characterization is performed by relying on set-theoretic methods in control. In particular, minimal robust positively invariant sets correspond to the smallest such sets and thus represent their least conservative characterization. The procedure is applied to the automatic generation control problem in an exemplary electrical transmission grid configuration with two control areas.

	abstract = {In the field of cognitive radio (CR), radio frequency (RF) transceivers must be efficient to save the terminal battery autonomy. Therefore, when designing the CR power amplifier (CR-PA), an obvious objective is to optimize efficiency over a large bandwidth. As a consequence, the CR-PA operates in its non-linear region and then frequency-dependent distortions are generated. This issue is all the more critical as one deals with high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) like those of OFDM signals. In this paper, we develop a digital post-distortion and detection technique in order to compensate the non-linearities generated by the CR-PA. It is based on a dynamic Volterra model to take into account the non-linear behavior of the CR-PA. The key feature of the proposed technique is the joint estimations of the model parameters and the CR-PA input samples. For this reason, an extended Kalman filter (EKF) is considered. However, as the model parameters can vary over time, several EKFs are combined by means of an interacting multiple model (IMM) algorithm. Simulation results confirm the relevance of the proposed postdistortion and detection technique. © 2015 IEEE.},

The algorithms use the iterative rational Krylov subspace framework of the H2-model reduction and construct a reduced order model which ensures a superior approximation accuracy within the frequency region which contains the local, interarea, and/or interplant oscillations. The algorithms also preserve the slow and poorly damped poles of the original power system model by using a hybrid approach to combine the modal preservation property of modal truncation and superior approximation accuracy of moment matching. Accuracy within the desired frequency region is achieved by using the generalized Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov (GKYP) lemma-based frequency-dependent extended realizations. The performance of the proposed algorithms is tested on practical numerical examples and a comparison with the well-known techniques is presented to highlight the efficacy of the proposed algorithms. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

During a transmission line fault, the resulted fast oscillation and voltage sag bring troubles to the monitoring devices which compute the frequency in real time. It is demanding to improve the accuracy of existing frequency calculation algorithms. This paper focuses on comparing the performance of four frequency computing algorithms by two fault conditions including a phase-to-ground fault and a phase-to-phase fault happened near peak. The result shows that all the algorithms have large fluctuation during a phase-to-phase fault due to the existence of phase shift. Two characteristic points on a waveform, namely the point-of-inception (POI) and point-of-recovery (POR) is identified by the algorithms on the phasor complex plane, which represent the start and the end of an event respectively. The waveform between POI and POR is effectively smoothed by a Kalman filter, which enhances the computation stability. © 2019 IEEE.},

It is well understood that this relationship, becoming obviously more and more important in the last years, has implications for frequency dynamics and power system stability. Frequency dynamics are indeed faster in power systems with low rotational inertia, making frequency control and power system stability more challenging. In the first paper, after discussing the impact of low rotational inertia on power system stability, a new Bayesian statistical inference approach has been proposed for the on-line estimation of the 'Renewable Energy Source Share' and thus the rotational inertia of a given system. This was discussed from the point of view of developing a theoretical methodological contribution. In this second part, extensive numerical simulations confirm that the proposed estimation technique constitutes a very fast, efficient and, especially, a robust method for an efficient assessment of rotational inertia. © 2018 IEEE.},

To address the issues that have arisen during the installation of the monitoring system, a new installation technique for the galloping monitoring terminal structure has been developed, and structural design and transmission line impact have been taken into account. A method combining Kalman and Mahony complementary filtering has been shown to solve the problem of wire twisting when galloping is taken into account. The displacement is derived by double-integrating the acceleration, although the trend term has a significant impact on the integration result. To handle the trend term issue and other error effects, a method combining the least-squares method, the adaptive smoothing method, and the time-frequency domain hybrid integration approach is used. Finally, the monitoring terminal’s structural design is simulated and evaluated, and the measured amplitude is assessed on a galloping standard test bench. The difference between the measured amplitude and the laboratory standard value is less than 10%, meeting the engineering design criteria. And the galloping trajectory is identical to the test bench trajectory, which is critical for user end monitoring. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Phase-looked loops (PLLs) have been well developed for synchronizing different power sources in a grid. Since MEA operates at variable frequency from 360 Hz to 800 Hz, a third-order model based steady-state linear Kalman filter PLL (SSLKF-PLL) has been proposed in literature to achieve fast tracking performance during such grid frequency variations. To suppress the potential disturbances due to harmonics in the grid, sensor scaling errors/unbalances and d.c offsets while maintaining low computational burden, this paper aims to enhance the disturbance rejection ability of SSLKF-PLL by adding a repetitive observer (RO). Simulation tests show that RO allows stable and effective suppression of disturbances from all above-mentioned sources during variable frequency operation. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {LEDs are widely employed as traffic lights. Because most LED traffic lights are driven by alternative power, they blink at high frequencies, even at twice their frequencies. We propose a method to detect a traffic light from images captured by a high-speed camera that can recognize a blinking traffic light. This technique is robust under various illuminations because it can detect traffic lights by extracting information from the blinking pixels at a specific frequency. The method is composed of six modules, which includes a band-pass filter and a Kalman filter. All the modules run simultaneously to achieve real-time processing and can run at 500 fps for images with a resolution of 800 × 600. This technique was verified on an original dataset captured by a high-speed camera under different illumination conditions such as a sunset or night scene. The recall and accuracy justify the generalization of the proposed detection system.

	abstract = {Single carrier-frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) has been adopted as the uplink transmission standard in fourth generation cellular network to enable the power efficiency transmission in mobile station. Since multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) is a promising technology to fully exploit the channel capacity in mobile radio network, this paper investigates the uplink transmission of SC-FDMA systems with orthogonal space frequency block codes (SFBC). It is necessary to joint consider the channel estimation, multiuser detection and turbo equalization for MU-MIMO SC-FDMA system. The pipelined turbo equalizer architecture has the feature that multiple soft-decisions become available at various processing stage. These multiple decisions from different pipeline stage have varying levels of reliability and can be used to track the variation of the channels. A critical issue in turbo receiver design is long processing latency due to inherent iterative processing of information. Pipeline architecture reduces the latency and improves processing throughput in turbo receivers and thus is the prevailing choice of the implementation architecture. The optimum channel estimator is a Kalman-based channel estimator for MU-MIMO SC-FDMA systems. In this paper, we use the pipelined structure to design the iterative channel tracking, multiuser detection and turbo equalization which with low latency, reasonable computation complexity and good channel tracking capability. Some simulation examples for uplink scenario are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes. © 2015 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Full-duplex (FD) communication at millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequencies suffers from a strong self-interference (SI) signal, which can only be partially canceled using conventional RF cancelation techniques. This is because current digital SI cancellation techniques, designed for microwave frequencies, ignore the rapid phase noise (PN) variation at mmWave frequencies, which can lead to large estimation errors. In this work, we consider a multiple-input multiple-output mmWave FD communication system. We propose an extended Kalman filter-based estimation algorithm to track the rapid variation of PN at mmWave frequencies. We derive a lower bound for the estimation error of PN at mmWave and numerically show that the mean square error performance of the proposed estimator approaches the lower bound. We also simulate the bit error rate performance of the proposed system and show the effectiveness of a digital canceler, which uses the proposed estimator to estimate the SI channel. The results show that for a 2×2 FD system with 64−QAM modulation and PN variance of 10−4, the residual SI power can be reduced to − 25 dB and − 40 dB, respectively, for signal-to-interference ratio of 0 and 15 dB. © 2019, The Author(s).},

Although some traditional grid voltage synchronization methods have good harmonic rejection capability and high precision, the transition detection time of the traditional grid voltage synchronization is not satisfied when considering the common grid faults such as symmetrical and asymmetrical voltage dips. In order to achieve the fast detection for voltage dips, this paper proposes a novel grid voltage synchronization method. It uses two low-order complex finite impulse response filters (FIR) to eliminate dominant low-order harmonics and separate the fundamental components respectively, and applies three second-order Kalman filters to estimate the fundamental frequency, positive-sequence and negative-sequence components respectively. Having the low-sampling rate and low-order structure, the proposed method has the high precision but faster detection response for voltage dips. And the experimental results show that the proposed grid voltage synchronization technique is easy to implement and has advantages regarding stability, rapidity, accuracy and the rejection of the harmonics. © 2018 KIEE EMECS (KIEE Electrical Machinery and Energy Conversion Systems).},

	abstract = {Smart-grid control aims to use current power converter technology of pump drives for grid stabilization. Hereby, fluctuations of the power grid frequency are transmitted to the pump drive resulting in pump speed changes. Along with the inherent impeller design these pump speed changes are resulting in pressure pulsations which propagate as hydro acoustic pressure waves throughout the pump system causing noise and vibration issues in the piping system. Therefor, in order to realize smart-grid control, a solution must be found to attenuate or counteract these hydro acoustic pressure waves. In an earlier work [1], an active noise control (ANC) system to reduce pressure pulsations at a pump's blade passing frequency (BPF) was published with the focus on constant points of operation. However, utilizing smart-grid control will results in high gradients of the pump speed and constantly changing points of operation are to be expected. This paper aims to attack those kinds of operating conditions. Within this paper, moving frequencies of interest at different pump speed gradient with and without active attenuation are analyzed and extracted from time series data by means of Vold-Kalman order tracking filter. In relation to possible fluctuations in the power grids frequency, the active attenuation performance of the ANC system is evaluated. © 2023 The Author(s)},

We present two model predictive control (MPC) algorithms that exploit a priori knowledge of delay statistics.

We simulate the closed loop system to quantify the error while the system tracks simplified power system signals of various frequencies.

	abstract = {In order to reduce the power consumption of GNSS receiver in the GNSS/INS integrated navigation system, an INS-aided low power GNSS receiver scheme using intermittent working pattern is proposed. The low power tracking loop consists of two different periods, namely active period and sleep period. Once the tracking loop is waken up to the active mode, the receiver will enter the tracking loop directly with the initial information supplied by INS to refine the parameters including Doppler frequency, code phase delay and carrier phase. At the end of active period, the PVT (position, velocity, time) results will be computed and sent to INS to correct the initial position and velocity values, which will be deployed as the starting point for the next period of dead-reckoning process. The actual static and dynamic experimental results show that, with the assistance of the inertial system, the PVT results by the proposed receiver are comparable to that of the traditional GNSS receiver by consuming only about 20% power of the traditional receiver. © 2019, Editorial Department of Journal of Chinese Inertial Technology.

Subsequently, the millimeter-wave radar in the ranging module was connected to the detection host via a wired interface. The radar data input utilized a millimeter-wave radar ranging algorithm based on improved robust Kalman filtering, providing real-time output of distance and azimuthal information of the power transmission lines at a frequency of 1Hz Experimental results demonstrated that the visual recognition algorithm based on standard deviation clustering effectively identified distances greater than 20 meters with a recognition accuracy of 93% and an output frequency of IHz The millimeter-wave radar ranging algorithm, based on improved robust Kalman filtering, achieved a ranging accuracy of ±0.1m and a ranging error of 2%, operating at an output frequency of IHz These findings confirm that the system adequately meets the overall requirements for real-time monitoring of mechanical collision prevention for power transmission lines.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are susceptible to jamming attacks due to the shared wireless medium. The jammer can disrupt any specific or entire radio frequency based on its function and strategies. Locating the jammer location is very important against the jamming in the wireless network and restore the communication channel. To support the existing anti-jamming techniques, we proposed an algorithm based on the Extended Kalman filter (EKF) and power received to track the jammer. Detecting jammer location is the first step taking to defend such attacks. Besides, estimating jammer location supports a wide range of defense. Range-based jammer localization technique based on the received power is used in this work to detect the external malicious node location by designed the position, velocity, and acceleration approach of Extended Kalman filter. An extensive simulation conducted to evaluate the performance of EKF compares to the Virtual Force Iteration Localization (VFIL), Weighted Centroid Localization (WCL), and Centroid Localization algorithms (CL). The EKF proves to be of high efficiency in comparison to VFIL, WCL, and CL. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In this article, a Kalman framework is proposed for dynamic energy-saving in wireless sensor networks used to monitor urban noise pollution. The energy-saving framework implements a dynamic power management strategy (DPMS) with the Kalman algorithm that varies the sensor node's sleep period according to the measured noise levels. An Internet-of-Things (IoT) edge-based self-sustaining long-range (LoRa) network is developed and used for ubiquitous monitoring and analysis of urban noise pollution. The network consists of a star topology with six LoRa battery-free wireless sensing nodes deployed in Mérida city downtown, each node powered by a green facade structure consisting of an array of plant-microbial fuel cells (P-MFC). The sensor node's prototype was implemented following Mexican regulations, transmitting the data packets with the open frequency band of 915 MHz, and monitoring the LoRa network from a web page. Experimental results prove a sustainable operation with a green facade P-MFC array power generation of 112.1 mW with an open-circuit voltage of 2.7 V and a short-circuit current of 180 mA. The sensor node's average power consumption is 11.2 mW; therefore, sufficient energy is generated for continuous monitoring. The efficient Kalman DPMS is also tested with the urban noise measurement estimation and adjusting the sleep period only if the urban measurement state estimation is above the threshold normativity. The system's low-power consumption allows to perform 70 continuous LoRa transmissions even when the energy harvester source is absent, and the power capacity of the green facade restores a supercapacitor full charge after only 4 min of a LoRa transmission. A 23.6% of energy was saved with Kalman DPMS in comparison with a continuous measurement system of 10-min uniform-sleep period. © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an improved current control strategy for a three-phase voltage source converter connected to distorted grid. The proposed controller can successfully compensate the induced harmonic currents, while suppressing possible active power ripple. To manage various objectives and deal with tough restrictions, model predictive control can offer a promising solution. However, a modified extended complex Kalman filter is introduced to estimate the positive and negative fundamental components of the grid voltages which are used with the real and reactive power references to generate pure sinusoidal reference currents without the need for a phase-locked loop (PLL), avoiding its challenges under abnormal grid conditions. An improved space vector-based model predictive control (SVM-MPC) is proposed to regulate the real and reactive power components. The main target of this controller is to maintain harmonic free grid currents, even in unbalanced and distorted grid conditions, with enhanced performance in terms of fast dynamic response and good steady-state behavior. The proposed SVM MPC uses Pythagoras theorem to determine duty factors, avoiding trigonometric functions, which improves the computational burden and implementation complexity. In addition, fixed switching frequency can be ensured. Simulation and experimental results are carried out to validate the effectiveness and the practical feasibility of the proposed controller under distorted grid conditions. © 2023 THE AUTHORS},

The impulse noises originating from primary disturbers, i.e., electrical and electronic appliances, reach the modem through different paths (channels) and hence pluralities of such noises increase. Diverse topologies of household electrical wiring introduce different types of time and frequency domain ambiguities in impulse noise characteristics before the noises reach the receiver. Hence, we propose that, if impulse noises are being observed at receiver and not directly at source, then time domain characterization should be done only after minimizing the effects of the channels from the observed noise recordings. In this paper we have demonstrated that time-domain pre-processing such as deconvolution is necessary to achieve reliable time-domain characterization if impulse noises are being observed at receiver. © 2018 IEEE.},

This paper presents a transformative approach, named deep learning reliability awareness of converters at the edge (Deep RACE), for real-time reliability modeling and prediction of high-frequency MOSFET power electronic converters. Deep RACE offers a holistic solution which comprises algorithm advances, and full system integration (from the cloud down to the edge node) to create a near real-time reliability awareness. On the algorithm side, this paper proposes a deep learning algorithmic solution based on stacked long short-term memory for collective reliability training and inference across collective MOSFET converters based on device resistance changes. Deep RACE also proposes an integrative edge-to-cloud solution to offer a scalable decentralized devices-specific reliability monitoring, awareness, and modeling. The MOSFET convertors are Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices which have been empowered with edge real-time deep learning processing capabilities. The proposed Deep RACE solution has been prototyped and implemented through learning from MOSFET data set provided by NASA. Our experimental results show an average miss prediction of 8.9% over five different devices which is a much higher accuracy compared to well-known classical approaches (Kalman filter and particle filter).

	abstract = {As a critically supporting and rotational component for wind turbines, blade bearings need special health monitoring for safe operation in actual industrial conditions. One of the main difficulties of the wind turbine blade bearing condition monitoring is noisy signals generated under fluctuating slow speed with heavy loads. This is because blade bearing rotation speed is influenced by blade flipping and external disturbances, and this influence is time-varying. This paper proposes a new method, Bayesian and Adapted Kalman Augmented Lagrangian (BAKAL), to filter the signal under this time-varying condition. The new method uses a two-step search (coarse and fine search) to deal with the filtering process based on Bayesian Augmented Lagrangian (BAL) framework. In addition, both linear and nonlinear effects and their sparsity are considered for model construction. Finally, the smearing problem in the frequency spectrum is dealt with through signal resample in the order domain for superior performance of fault diagnosis. The proposed BAKAL algorithm is strictly validated in several experiments under approximately fixed speed and variable speed within the condition of heavy loadings. The experiments use an industrial and rotational wind turbine blade bearing with natural defects, which has been served in an actual wind power plant for over 15 years. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The performance of the closed-loop control system is determined by the accuracy of the feedback signal to some extent. In most motor drive systems, the position and speed signals come from the optical encoder. Thus, to reduce the quantization error from encoder and achieve better speed measurement results are the focuses of scholars and engineers. Although many improved speed measurement methods have been proposed, there are still few literatures discussed about the frequency characteristic of the encoder quantization noise. Even in some algorithms like Kalman filter based speed measurement methods usually regard the quantization noise as white noise. In this paper, a noise frequency characteristic model of encoder-based speed measurement in motor drive is built up. According to this model, the variation rule of the noise frequency is found. Besides, a variable-period noise shaping method is proposed to reduce the impact of quantization noise. Both the notch filter and a finite impulse response (FIR) filter are used to cope with the quantization noise. The frequency model and noise shaping method are verified by experiment results. © 2019 The Korean Institute of Power Electronics (KIPE).},

	abstract = {Industrial cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are large-scale, geographically dispersed, and life-critical systems, in which lots of sensors and actuators are embedded and networked together to facilitate real-time monitoring and closed-loop control. Their intrinsic features in geographic space and resources put forward to urgent requirements of reliability and scalability for designed filtering or control schemes. This paper presents a review of the state-of-the-art of distributed filtering and control of industrial CPSs described by differential dynamics models. Special attention is paid to sensor networks, manipulators, and power systems. For real-time monitoring, some typical Kalman-based distributed algorithms are summarized and their performances on calculation burden and communication burden, as well as scalability, are discussed in depth. Then, the characteristics of non-Kalman cases are further disclosed in light of constructed filter structures. Furthermore, the latest development is surveyed for distributed cooperative control of mobile manipulators and distributed model predictive control in industrial automation systems. By resorting to droop characteristics, representative distributed control strategies classified by controller structures are systematically summarized for power systems with the requirements of power sharing and voltage and frequency regulation. In addition, distributed security control of industrial CPSs is reviewed when cyber-attacks are taken into consideration. Finally, some challenges are raised to guide the future research. © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Electrocardiogram (ECG) is the graph obtained from the electrical activity of the heart and is used to examine function of heart and for diagnosis cardiac problems. The voltage level of ECG signal ranges from as low as 0.5 to 5mV and frequency components fall into the range of 0.05 to 100Hz. Various noises like Power Line Interference (PLI), baseline wander and noise due to muscles contraction and relaxation get added into the recorded ECG signal. Out of them, PLI is considered to be the major source of noise. PLI may be stationary or non stationary. Non adaptive filters are employed to remove stationary power line interference and adaptive cancellers are used to handle non-stationary power line interference. In this paper adaptive LMS algorithm along with Kalman filtering became KLMS has been investigated to eliminate PLI from contaminated ECG signal. The results of KLMS filter has been compared with the LMS filter before and after filtering the ECG signal. Results shows MSE equal to 0.6314 and 0.0409 before filtering for LMS and KLMS filter respectively. MSE equal to 0.1983 and 0.0245 after filtering for LMS and KLMS filter respectively. Also, PSNR before filtering is 50.1279 and 62.0168 for LMS and KLMS filter respectively. PSNR after filtering is 55.1586 and 64.2352 for LMS and KLMS respectively. The filters algorithm has designed using MATLAB software and tested on ECG signal contaminated with power line frequencies. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Objective: ECG-derived respiration (EDR) is a low-cost and productive means for capturing respiratory activity. In particular, as the primary procedure in some cardiorespiratory-related studies, the quality of EDR is decisive for the performance of subsequent analyses. Approach: In this paper, we proposed a novel EDR method based on the feature derived from the first moment (mean frequency) of the power spectrum (FMS). After obtaining the EDR signal from the feature, we introduced the Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) smoother to enhance the similarity of the EDR signal to the reference respiration. The assessment of the approach consisted of two steps: 1) the performance of extracted feature was verified against R-peak misalignment and noise. 2) the enhancement of IMM smoother to EDR waveforms was evaluated based on waveform correlation and respiratory rate estimation. All the assessments were conducted under the Fantasia database and Drivers database. Results: The FMS improved robustness against R peak offsets compared to most established feature-based EDR algorithms, but a slight 5% improvement of waveform correlation against RR interval-based feature under accurate R peaks. The IMM smoother performed similarly with the Kalman filter in the static database but realized the enhancement of some extent of the EDR waveform in the ambulatory database. Significance: The proposed method investigated frequency domain mapping of ECG morphological changes caused by respiratory modulation and explained the EDR signal as a non-stationary time series, which provided a direction of better fitting the natural respiration process and enhancing the EDR waveform.  © 2023 IEEE.},

The proposed method relies on the mapping of nodal active- and reactive-power injections to line flows, which are obtained via a measurement-based approach. Building on this, we outline a combined sparsity-promoting linear-quadratic regulator and Kalman-filter design. The optimal controller sparsity is identified using the alternating direction method of multipliers, which strikes a balance between feedback controller sparsity and the closed-loop dynamic performance. With this, we optimally dispatch generators and controllable loads to achieve desired line flows while ensuring zero steady-state frequency offset.

The problem of the introduced 'hybrid' estimator is a proper transition between the EKF and the hf injection strategy. The transition is based on calculating of probabilities for each particular estimation algorithm. We proposed two strategies for proper algorithm selection. The first one is with constant prior probability of particular algorithms and the second one has variable prior probabilities. For their changes is used transition matrix that is known from Markov system.

	abstract = {Enhancing the power performance of wave energy converters is undoubtedly a step required to reduce the cost of energy from this source of renewable energy, thereby making it competitive to other sources of renewable energy. Increasing the power absorption can be achieved by utilizing smart and advanced control algorithms. There are theories for a variety of advanced control algorithms, but few have proved stable and reliable for real applications. An often used, and robust method for practical applications, is to apply a simple gain scheduling controller where the control gains are parameterized in function of the sea state, and not at wave-by-wave level. This paper presents a wave-by-wave adaptive controller, which has proven a robust method that can increase the power absorption performance. The use of the wave by wave adaptive controller is achieved by the identification of the instantaneous fundamental frequency in real time. One numerical procedure to achieve this frequency is using non-linear Kalman filters. But the pitfall of these non-linear filters is their sensitivity to the parameter tuning, which decreases practical usability, reliability and robustness. This paper focuses on two complementary topics. The first topic will tackle the implementation of a reliable filter for the identification of the instantaneous fundamental frequency using a particle filter. The second topic will demonstrate the implementation of the wave-by-wave gain scheduling controller. The case study is a scaled absorber of the Floating Power Plant wave and wind energy converter.

	abstract = {Supercapacitors have been widely used in public transportation for the advantages of high power density and extremely long lifetime. Owing to the high-power charging requirements of supercapacitors, the multicharger cooperative charging method has been applied to suppress the current imbalance among chargers. However, the cooperative charging system is vulnerable to cyber attacks with false data injections, which degrades the reliability of the charging system. To address this challenge, in this article, a detection method for a false data injection attack (FDIA) is proposed for the cooperative charging system. First, we introduce the cooperative charging system and analyze the possible cyber attacks. Then, an FDIA detection method is proposed based on a Kalman filter and the time-frequency features of chargers' currents. A three-charger laboratory platform is built to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method can detect the FDIA effectively when compared with the existing methods. © 1972-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Ensuring safety in real-world robotic systems is often challenging due to unmodeled disturbances and noisy sensors. To account for such stochastic uncertainties, many robotic systems leverage probabilistic state estimators such as Kalman filters to obtain a robot's belief, i.e. a probability distribution over possible states. We propose belief control barrier functions (BCBFs) to enable risk-aware control, leveraging all information provided by state estimators. This allows robots to stay in predefined safety regions with desired confidence under these stochastic uncertainties. BCBFs are general and can be applied to a variety of robots that use extended Kalman filters as state estimator. We demonstrate BCBFs on a quadrotor that is exposed to external disturbances and varying sensing conditions. Our results show improved safety compared to traditional state-based approaches while allowing control frequencies of up to 1 kHz.  © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In digital wireless communications, the received signal can be strongly altered by the environment and may contain Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI). To remove or reduce the ISI i.e. equalize, the impulse response of the propagation channel can be estimated. The Kalman Filter (KF) is an inescapable estimation algorithm in linear systems because of its optimality in terms of Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) under certain assumptions. However, in real conditions, implementations of KF are often difficult because of the necessity of hand-tuning parameters. In this paper, we present the Smart Kalman Filter (SKF), a hybrid architecture that combines a KF and the power of neural networks to extract relevant features from data to benefit from an adaptive KF that is automatically well tuned over time. We demonstrate in this paper that the proposed SKF is up to 5dB better at low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and 3dB better at high SNR than Least Square (LS) algorithm in a time-varying channel estimation context with abrupt Doppler frequency variations. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a novel distributed secondary cooperative control based on neural inverse optimal control scheme is synthesized for microgrids considering island and grid-connected modes. This approach is developed for each distributed generator to track frequency and voltage predefined values for island mode, and to track active and reactive power references for grid-connected mode, and for smooth switching between these two modes. To achieve these goals, a secondary control layer is proposed to define the required currents trajectories, which then are controlled using the primary controller. Both control layers are synthesized using recurrent high order neural network on-line trained using an extended Kalman filter, which builds up neural models and is to be used to implement the respective inverse optimal controllers. In addition, a pinning technique is also used for achieving synchronization of all distributed generators only requiring neighborhood information. Thus, a large reduction in the communication network complexity is obtained and the control system reliability is improved. Simulations are performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme with a microgrid benchmark. The obtained results illustrate adequate performances of the proposed scheme to operate the microgrids in island mode, grid-connected mode, and to achieve seamless switching between these two modes. © 2010-2012 IEEE.},

Estimation of real-time power is challenging in single-phase systems due to the presence of double-frequency ripple in IPS. In conventional methods the low bandwidth filters are used to remove this ripple. In this paper the real-time power estimation is obtained first by presenting the problem in terms time dependent linear optimization and then solved by using a least square (LS) method. In order to tackle the drawbacks associated with the conventional methods based on dq rotating frames and grid synchronization algorithms, the proposed algorithm is modified to be recursive and windows type to reduce the computational time. It is mathematically shown that by adding one additional parameter the active and reactive power estimation can be made independent of the initial time value. Simulation and experimental results prove the superior performance of the proposed estimator in comparison with the conventional estimators and the other least square algorithms, such as Kalman filters and forgetting factor, in term of convergence time and the amount of undershoot/overshoot in estimation of active and reactive power from instantaneous power signal. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The large-scale renewable energy penetration to the power system leads to the reduction of the system inertia. It is of great significance to use the synchronous phasor measurement unit (PMU) to estimate the system inertia level online. Considering the spatial distribution characteristics of the power system frequency dynamics, it is feasible to carry out the online inertia estimation in regions. The frequency response regioning is not only related to the power grid topologies and parameters, but also to the system operation points, disturbance types and locations. So, itis difficult for a single fixed regioning scheme to ensure that the regioning results meet various operating conditions of the power system. At the same time, the real-time regioning scenarios also puts forward higher requirements for the rapidity of the inertia parameter identifications. This paper analyzes the principle of the on-line estimation of the regional inertia of the power system, and expounds the requirements of the real-time regioning of the frequency dynamic response. Then, a dynamic real-time frequency partition method is proposed, which uses the dynamic time warping index and the k-medoids algorithm to cluster the measured frequency response curves of nodes in the whole network online. The inertia parameter identification based on the Kalman filter is given to ensure that the inertia parameter calculation meets the real-time requirements. The influence of various errors on the system regioning and inertia parameter identification results is further analyzed. Finally, the effectiveness, the real-time inertia tracking capability and the adaptability to different operation scenarios of the proposed method are verified in the IEEE 39 bus system. The online estimation of the regional inertia of the power system proposed in this paper uses the measured frequency response of the PMU to update the regioning of the power system in real time so as to ensure the consistency of the regional frequency response under various operating points and disturbances, which has the potential of field application. © 2023 Power System Technology Press.

The flowmeter is composed of hardware circuits such as STM32F407 (ARM Cortex 32-bit microcontroller) main control chip and high-precision timing chip TDC-GP22 (time to digital converter). The software uses a new data-filtering algorithm combining Kalman filtering algorithm and arithmetic average algorithm to improve the measurement accuracy of ultrasonic gas flowmeter. Through experimental comparison, we find that the filtering algorithm effectively reduces the measurement error of the system.

Moreover, it reduces the zero-drift to about one half of the original, which significantly improves the stability of the system.

	abstract = {The synchronization between the power grid and distributed power sources is a crucial issue in the concept of smart grids. For tracking the real-Time frequency and phase of three-phase grids, phase-locked loop (PLL) technology is commonly used. Many existing PLLs with enhanced disturbance/harmonic rejection capabilities, either fail to maintain fast response or are not adaptive to grid frequency variations or have high computational complexity. This article, therefore, proposes a low computational burden repetitive controller (RC) assisted PLL (RCA-PLL) that is not only effective on harmonic rejection but also has remarkable steady-state performance while maintaining fast dynamic. Moreover, the proposed PLL is adaptive to variable frequency conditions and can self-learn the harmonics to be canceled. The disturbance/harmonic rejection capabilities together with dynamic and steady-state performances of the RCA-PLL have been highlighted in this article. The proposed approach is also experimentally compared to the synchronous rotation frame PLL (SRF-PLL) and the steady-state linear Kalman filter PLL (SSLKF-PLL), considering the effect of harmonics from the grid-connected converters, unbalances, sensor scaling errors, dc offsets, grid frequency variations, and phase jumps. The computational burden of the RCA-PLL is also minimized, achieving an experimental execution time of only 12~\mu \text{s}. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Conventional GPS and encoder-based solutions for the real-time position and velocity tracking of tethered aircraft in airborne wind energy (AWE) systems are known to have some practical limitations. As an alternative, the main contribution of this paper is to present a setup based on 2.4 GHz radio-frequency (RF) devices, for which there are still no reported experimental results in the literature. To this end, four estimation algorithms are formulated to a lateration problem: linear and nonlinear least squares (kinematic approaches), as well as the extended and the unscented Kalman filters (dynamic approaches). The Cramér–Rao lower bound is computed to serve as a benchmark for the filtering performance in terms of the position estimate covariance. Drawbacks of the two kinematic algorithms are discussed, followed by the advantages of using the two Kalman filters in a sensor fusion scheme that uses not only the RF rangings but also line angles and length measurements obtained from rotary encoders at the ground station. Estimates computed from field experimental data acquired with a small-scale AWE prototype are validated against the encoder measurements. The results show that setups based on RF ranging devices have many advantages over more conventional positioning techniques such as those based on line-following mechanisms with encoders, GPS and IMU, and computer vision, representing a promising solution for AWE applications. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {It is now well understood that by exploiting the available additional spatial dimensions, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems provide capacity gains, compared to a single-input single-output systems without increasing the overall transmit power or requiring additional bandwidth. However, these large capacity gains are feasible only when the perfect knowledge of the channel is available to the receiver. Consequently, when the channel knowledge is imperfect, as is common in practical settings, the impact of the achievable capacity needs to be evaluated. In this study, we begin with a general MIMO framework at the outset and specialize it to the case of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems by decoupling channel estimation from data detection. Cyclic-prefixed OFDM systems have attracted widespread interest due to several appealing characteristics not least of which is the fact that a single-tap frequency-domain equalizer per subcarrier is sufficient due to the circulant structure of the resulting channel matrix. We consider a low-mobility wireless channel which exhibits inter-block channel variations and apply Kalman tracking when MIMO-OFDM communication is performed. Furthermore, we consider the signal transmission to contain a stream of training and information symbols followed by information symbols alone. By relying on predicted channel states when training symbols are absent, we aim to understand how the improvements in channel capacity are affected by imperfect channel knowledge. We show that the Kalman recursion procedure can be simplified by the optimal minimum mean square error training design. Using the simplified recursion, we derive capacity upper and lower bounds to evaluate the performance of the system. © 2013 Pagadarai et al.; licensee Springer.},

The resonant frequency offset of an LCL filter will be caused by the change in power grid impedance and filter inductance. To this end, a strong adaptability control based on dual-division-summation (D-D-Σ) control is proposed in this article, which considers both the accuracy of grid-connected current tracking and resonance suppression under the variation of grid impedance and filter inductance. A full inductance parameter identification method based on an extended Kalman filter for simultaneously estimating filter inductance and grid impedance is proposed without remote voltage sampling. An enumeration method of the Routh array with less calculation is proposed. The algebraic relationship between control parameters and total inductance parameters is obtained by the Routh criterion. A gain correction method to realize strong adaptive control is proposed to deal with the variation of grid impedance and filter inductance. The experimental results prove the feasibility of D-D-Σ control in a three-phase LCL-type grid-connected inverter under the variation of grid impedance and filter inductance.  © 1986-2012 IEEE.},

This paper presents a method to estimate the state variables combining the measurement of power demand at each bus with the data collected from a limited number of Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs). Although PMU data are usually assumed to be perfectly synchronized with the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), this work explicitly considers the presence of time-synchronization errors due, for instance, to the actual performance of GPS receivers and the limited stability of the internal oscillator. The proposed algorithm is a recursive Kalman filter which not only estimates the state variables of the power system, but also the frequency deviations causing clock offsets which eventually affect the timestamps of the measures returned by different PMUs. The proposed solution was tested and compared with alternative approaches using both synthetic data applied to the IEEE 123 bus distribution feeder and real-field data collected from a small-size medium-voltage (MV) distribution system located inside the EPFL campus in Lausanne. Results show the validity of the proposed method in terms of state estimation accuracy. In particular, when some synchronization errors are present, the proposed algorithm can estimate and compensate for them. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the finite control set model predictive control is combined with the vector operation technique to be applied in the control of a three-phase active power filter. Typically, in the finite control set technique applied to three-phase power converters, eight different vectors are considered in order to obtain the optimum control signal by minimizing a cost function. On the other hand, the vector operation technique is based on dividing the grid voltage period into six different regions. The main advantage of combining both techniques is that for each region the number of possible voltage vectors to be considered can be reduced to a half, thus reducing the computational load employed by the control algorithm. Besides, in each region, only two phase-legs are switching at high frequency while the remaining phase-leg is maintained to a constant dc-voltage value during this interval. Accordingly, a reduction of the switching losses is obtained. Unlike the typical model predictive control methods which make use of the discrete differential equations of the converter, this method considers a Kalman filter in order to improve the behavior of the closed-loop system in noisy environments. Selected experimental results are exposed in order the demonstrate the validity of the control proposal. © 2017 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

However, the traditional resonant frequency tracking control with the idea of stroke-current phase suffers some serious problems, like slow tracking speed, low accuracy, large current peak during starting, fluctuate amplitude of piston, and so on. In this paper, a Kalman filter for the mechanical system of LOM is proposed, which avoids the impact of environmental noise and obtains the observed values of load parameters. On this basis, a parameter correction scheme based on gradient descent method is proposed. By calculating the corresponding gradient matrix, iterative adjustment and correction of the covariance matrix in the Kalman filter are realized. The combination of the two realizes the load parameter prediction of the LOM, and on this basis, completes the frequency control of the LOM. Comprehensive simulation results have fully demonstrated the advantages of proposed control strategy compared to those of traditional methods. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This study examines the effectiveness of a model predictive controller (MPC) on the multimode active suspension concept to reduce driver absorbed power. A multimode suspension uses additional degrees-of-freedom beyond a traditional active suspension. This allows the suspension to address disturbances with multiple frequencies when coupled with a noncausal control scheme such as MPC. A half-car model is developed by placing both active and passive components in series to mitigate high and low frequency disturbances at the tire-road interface. A stepwise MPC with preview information is applied to the model to measure an incoming disturbance. The model includes noise in state feedback and preview information. A Kalman filter addresses process and measurement noise while the preview information is filtered using an exponential moving average. Process and Measurement noise are considered to be known. Four disturbance profiles are examined: step, two-mode, three-mode, and an ISO8608 Class D profile. Weights used for the MPC process are optimized for each profile according to an objective function based on driver absorbed power. For each profile the response for uncontrolled, controlled, and controlled with preview is examined to assess effectiveness of the multimode suspension. Results demonstrate the utility of the multimode suspension supplemented with MPC for each profile. Driver absorbed power decreases by 68%, 99%, 73%, and 89% for the step, two-mode, three-mode, and ISO8608 Class D profile, respectively. Examination of the natural, disturbance, and forcing frequencies suggests that the MPC accounts for the damped natural frequencies of the system in response to incoming disturbances. The system shows potential to improve performance of vehicles traversing extreme terrain or maintaining a stable chassis for a variety of applications. Future work includes examination of the relationship between the damped natural frequencies, the disturbance, and the resulting control law. © 2023 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

	abstract = {In more-electronics power systems, grid-forming power converters, which operate as ac voltage sources, regulate the grid frequency and voltages in replacement of synchronous generators. Notably, grid impedances greatly influence the small signal and voltage stability of grid-forming converters. As such, prior knowledge of grid impedances can be very helpful for controller design. However, grid impedance estimation schemes are normally designed for current-controlled grid-following converters. Moreover, they are either very complicated or only yield grid inductances in a generally intrusive way. To fill this research gap, an impedance estimation method well suited to grid-forming converters is proposed. The method consists of four operating modes, which work well in voltage and power control cases. In the voltage control case, the voltage amplitude perturbation or phase angle information is exploited. Subsequently, the grid inductance and resistance are derived from power measurement. Alternatively, the active or reactive power information serves to estimate the grid impedance in the power control case. The proposed method features an easy implementation without any harmonic distortion, safety concern, or dependence on control parameters. Moreover, the method operates nonintrusively in most scenarios. Furthermore, a novel Kalman filtering scheme is proposed to provide added incentives. Finally, simulation and experimental results validate the effectiveness and simplicity of the proposed method. © 1986-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In this paper, instead of adopting different algorithms to deal with the different impairments separately based on different signal processing structures, we proposed a joint linear impairment equalization scheme using a two-stage cascade Kalman structure in which the first stage solves the residual chromatic dispersion (rCD), the rotation of state of polarization (RSOP) and polarization mode dispersion (PMD), and the second stage compensates for the carrier frequency offset (CFO) and carrier phase noise (CPN). The structures of the two stages are similar with a seamless connection and possess a clear logic architecture. The stages are compatible with each other and achieve excellent performance. We aim to use this two-stage Kalman scheme as a comprehensive DSP equalization scheme to replace the combined algorithms of the constant modulus algorithm (CMA), improved Mth-power algorithm (IMP), and blind phase search (BPS). Simulations based on a 28 Gbaud polarization division multiplexed quadrature-phase shift keying coherent optical communication system show that the proposed two-stage Kalman scheme comprehensively outperforms the CMA-IMP-BPS scheme in solving the problems of RSOP, PMD, rCD, CFO, and CPN. The experimental results confirm the simulation results. In addition, the complexity of the proposed Kalman scheme is relatively less than the CMA-IMP-BPS scheme. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Current energy policies are encouraging the connection to the grid of power generation based on low-polluting technologies, mainly those using renewable sources with distribution networks. Photovoltaic (PV) systems have experienced a wide and high increase in their adoption as an energy source over the last years. Hence, it has become increasingly important to understand technical challenges, facing high penetration of PV systems on the grid, especially considering the effects of uncertainty and intermittency of this source on power quality, reliability and stability of the electric distribution system. On the other hand, the connections for distributed generators, by PV panels, changes the voltage profile on low voltage power systems. This fact can affect the distribution networks onto which they are attached causing overvoltage, undervoltage, frequency oscillations and changes in protection design. In order to predict these disturbances, due to this PV penetration, this article analyzes seven training algorithms used in artificial neural networks, with NARX architecture, for the generated active power estimating, and thus the state of the distribution network onto which these micro generators are connected and then compare their best statistical results with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and the Kalman filter (KF) techniques. The results show that the best training algorithm used for the ANN learning obtained a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 0.02%, while the SVM and KF techniques obtained 0.33% and 3.41%, respectively. Taking in account the other statistical analysis, we concluded that artificial neural networks are more suitable for this type of problem than SVM and KF. In addition, performing the training process with cell temperature data improves the accuracy of the resulting estimations. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Cardiac diseases constitute a major root of global mortality and they are likely to persist. Electrocardiogram (ECG) is widely opted in clinics to detect countless heart illnesses. Numerous artifacts interfere with the ECG signal, and their elimination is vital to allow medical specialists to acquire valuable statistics from the ECG. The utmost artifact that is added to the ECG signal is power line interference (PLI). Numerous filtering methods have been employed in the literature to eliminate PLI from noisy ECG. This article proposes an extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based adaptive noise canceller (ANC) that comprises PLI frequency as a distinct model parameter. Thus, it is capable of tracking PLI with drifting frequency. The proposed canceller's performance is compared with state-space recursive least squares (SSRLSs) filter-based PLI canceling. The evaluation is carried out for four cases of PLI, that is, PLI with known amplitude and frequency, PLI with unknown amplitude and frequency, PLI with drifting amplitude and frequency, and PLI removal from a real-time ECG recording. The samples of the Massachusetts Institude of Technology (MIT)-Boston's Beth Israel Hospital (BIH) arrhythmia database are considered for the first three cases, whereas, for the fourth case, real ECG signal is taken from armed forces institude of cardiology, the national institude of heart diseases (AFIC/NIHD), Pakistan. Mean square error, frequency spectrum, and noise reduction are selected as performance metrics for comparison. Simulation results depict that the presented EKF-based ANC system outperforms the SSRLS-based ANC system and effectively eliminates PLI from ECG under all four investigated scenarios.

	abstract = {The paper presents a fast and accurate algorithm for estimating four significant parameters (i.e., amplitude, frequency, phase angle, and damping factor) of a typical transient signal. The method can be connoted as the constrained symmetric strong tracking square-root cubature Kalman filter (CSSTSCKF). The important aspects of the proposed algorithm are: 1) constraints are imposed on the state vectors by way of a logarithmic barrier function that is either ignored or handled heuristically; 2) symmetric sub-optimal multiple fading factors (FFs) are augmented into the predicted covariance matrix to capture sudden changes and to tune the gain matrix in real-time; moreover, symmetry of the covariance matrix is guaranteed by the influence of Cholesky triangular decomposition; 3) effect of noise can be adjusted by tuning the soften factor. Several case studies have been simulated to evaluate the proposed algorithm with respect to some of the well-known state-of-the-art methods. The real-time performance has been evaluated by flashing the filter codes into an ARM Cortex-M7 processor board and tracking the real-time signal from the experimental test bench. The results, presented herein, indicate that the CSSTSCKF remarkably outperforms all other considered techniques. Furthermore, the stability analysis of the nonlinear filter has been proved based on the constructor expression considering the boundedness of the estimation errors and other sub-items. © 2013 IEEE.},

The two schemes are compared advantageously in terms of computation speed and performance with a four-cycle short-time fast Fourier transform algorithm.

Control designs that enable large wind farms to follow a time-varying power trajectory are complicated by aerodynamic interactions that make it impossible to decouple upstream wind turbine control actions from downstream power production. This coupling is particularly important in applications where the reference trajectory is changing faster than, or at a similar rate as, the propagation of turbine wakes through the farm. In this work we overcome these difficulties by using a dynamic wake model that accounts for wake expansion, advection, and multi-wake interactions within a model-based receding horizon controller for coordinated control of a large multi-turbine wind farm. An ensemble Kalman filter is employed for state estimation and error correction at the turbine level. We implement the controller in high-fidelity numerical simulations of a wind farm with 84 turbines and then test the controlled farm's ability to track a power reference signal. The results demonstrate the ability of the control algorithm to track two types of power reference signals used by a US independent system operator. © 2017 American Automatic Control Council (AACC).},

	abstract = {Renewable energy power generation systems such as photovoltaic and wind power have characteristics of intermittency and volatility, which can cause disturbances to the grid frequency. The battery system of electric vehicles (EVs) is a mobile energy storage system that can participate in bidirectional interaction with the power grid and support the frequency stability of the grid. Lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) battery systems, with their advantages of high safety and long cycle life, are widely used in EVs and participate in frequency regulation (FR) services. Accurate assessment of the state of charge (SOC) and remaining available energy (RAE) status in LiFePO4 batteries is crucial in formulating control strategies for battery systems. However, establishing an accurate voltage model for LiFePO4 batteries is challenging due to the hysteresis of open circuit voltage and internal temperature changes, making it difficult to accurately assess their SOC and RAE. To accurately evaluate the SOC and RAE of LiFePO4 batteries in dynamic FR working conditions, a thermal-electric-hysteresis coupled voltage model is built. Based on this model, closed-loop optimal SOC estimation is achieved using the extended Kalman filter algorithm to correct the initial value of SOC calculated by ampere-hour integration. Further, RAE is accurately estimated using a method based on future voltage prediction. The research results demonstrate that the thermal-electric-hysteresis coupling model exhibits high accuracy in simulating terminal voltage under a 48 h dynamic FR working condition, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of only 18.7 mV. The proposed state estimation strategy can accurately assess the state of LiFePO4 batteries in dynamic FR working conditions, with an RMSE of 1.73% for SOC estimation and 2.13% for RAE estimation. This research has the potential to be applied in battery management systems to achieve an accurate assessment of battery state and provide support for the efficient and reliable operation of battery systems. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Phasor estimation under dynamic conditions has been under study recently by relaxing the amplitude and phase of the static phasor. This paper will review some methods to estimate dynamic phasor by nonlinear Kalman filters. Nonlinear Kalman filters have found an application in the tracking of time-varying amplitude and phase. Five nonlinear Kalman filtering methods for dynamic phasor estimation are examined in this paper. These methods are: EKF1 stands for first-order Extended Kalman filter, EKF2 stands for second-order Extended Kalman, UKF stands for Unscented Kalman filter, GHKF stands for Gauss Hermite Kalman filter, and finally CKF stands for Cubature Kalman filter. This paper describes the theoretical processes of these methods and demonstrates their effectiveness in dynamic phasor estimation by some test signal simulations in MATLAB. The simulation section shows that nonlinear Kalman filters give more accuracy than linear Kalman filters when the phasor is relaxed by modulated amplitude and phase. Moreover, comparative assessments among the performance of five nonlinear Kalman filters are done for dynamic phasor estimation, and also their performances are compared with the other methods which have already been published. According to the simulation results, EKF1 gives the highest accuracy during steady-state ( 2 × 10^-13 ) because the signal model is more similar to the estimation model of EK1 during the steady-state condition. However, the other non-linear Kalman filters show better performances in dynamic conditions. When the phasor is a time-varying amplitude and phase, filters give the same accuracy ( TVE=0.5 % ). A step-change in amplitude and phase creates different overshoot and response times, but EKF2 shows the least overshoot (3.2%) and the longest response time (7.6 ms). Computation burden and noise indices can discriminate the methods from other viewpoints. The computation burden of GHKF is drastically increased when the number of states gives rise. CKF shows an appropriate performance when the number of samples and the number of the state increased in the input signal. EKF1 is not a good solution for noise infiltration when SNR is less than 40 dB, but CKF gives the highest accuracy in high noise levels. Compared to the six already pblished methods, CK shows the best performance with a reasonable estimation error ( TVE=0.1101 % ) and simulation time (0.6146 ms).  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {To realize permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) in the full speed domain without speed sensor operation, a hybrid control method combining I/F startup and extended Kalman filter (EKF) is proposed in this paper. This method employs I/F startup to transition at low speed, effectively resolving the issue that the position estimation method based on the back electromotive force (EMF) model fails at zero speed and low speed, and converts to EKF for speed closed-loop vector control at medium and high speed. Moreover, a new feedback regulation mechanism as a solution to the problem of smooth switching between the two methods is proposed. First, the power angle is determined based on the relationship between the given I/F frequency and the estimated EKF position angle. Using the information of power angle, the damping torque of the system is increased to reduce velocity fluctuations during I/F startup. In addition, the balance point of current and position error angle is adjusted using the closed-loop information of position error angle to reduce the torque abrupt change before and after switching, thereby making the motor switching process to EKF speed closed-loop control more stable. Finally, simulation results are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. © 2023 by the authors.},

However, historical records prove that the data transfer has always been vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Unless these cyber-attacks are identified and cordoned off, they may lead to black-out and result in national security issues. This paper proposes an optimal two-stage Kalman filter (OTS-KF) for simultaneous state and cyber-attack estimation in automatic generation control (AGC) system. Biases/cyber-attacks are modeled as unknown inputs in the AGC dynamics. Five types of cyber-attacks, i.e., false data injection (FDI), data replay attack, denial of service (DoS), scaling, and ramp attacks, are injected into the measurements and estimated using OTS-KF. As the load variations of each area are seldom available, OTS-KF is reformulated to estimate the states and outliers along with the load variations of the system. The proposed technique is validated on the benchmark two-area, three-area, and five-area power system models. The simulation results under various test conditions demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed filter.  © 2013 State Grid Electric Power Research Institute.},

In this study, a data-driven approach based on output-only observer/Kalman filter identification (O3KID) combined with the eigensystem realisation algorithm (ERA) was proposed to extract electromechanical modes (frequency, damping ratio and mode shape) from synchronised ambient data. As a key for extracting a reduced-order state matrix using the ERA, the Markov parameters (impulse responses) are first estimated by employing O3KID on multi-channel ambient data. O3KID makes it possible to identify the modes with the ERA using only output ambient data, while ensuring the reliability of the extractions of frequencies, damping ratios and mode shapes. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated by employing the IEEE 16-generator 5-Area system and measured data from a real power system. The estimation results in all cases as well as comparison results with the RDT-ERA method and NExT-ERA method indicate that the O3KID-ERA method is a promising method for ambient data-driven electromechanical oscillation modes extraction. © 2020 Institution of Engineering and Technology.

This paper presents a robust and automated real-time monitoring system for detecting grid oscillations and analyzing their mode shapes using PMU measurements. A novel Extended Kalman Filtering (EKF) based approach is introduced to detect and analyze oscillations. To further improve the accuracy and efficiency of the presented software system, the EKF approach takes advantages of three effective signal processing methods (including Prony's Method, Hankel Total Least Square (HTLS) Method, EKF) and adopts a novel voting schema to significantly reduce the computation cost. Results from these methods are processed through a time-series filter to ensure the consistency of detected oscillations and reduce the number of false alarms. The Density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) method is used to accurately classify oscillation modes and the PMU measurement channels. The LFODA system has been functioning well in the State Grid Jiangsu Electric Power Company with 176 PMUs and 1000+ channels since February 2018, demonstrating outstanding performance in reducing false alarms with much less computational cost. © 2018 CSEE},

	abstract = {A new approach is proposed for obtaining a non-linear area-based equivalent model of power systems to express the inter-area oscillations using synchronised phasor measurements. The generators that remain coherent for inter-area disturbances over a wide range of operating conditions define the areas, and the reduced model is obtained by representing each area by an equivalent machine. The parameters of the reduced system are identified by processing the obtained measurements, and a non-linear Kalman estimator is then designed for the estimation of equivalent area angles and frequencies. The simulation of the approach on a two-area system shows substantial reduction of non-inter-area modes in the estimated angles. The proposed methods are also applied to a ten-machine system to illustrate the feasibility of the approach on larger and meshed networks. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2014.},

Unlike half-duplex (HD), IBFD-IAB-nodes (i.e., roadside units) in this work are doing sensing and communications at the same time and frequency, which enhance the spectral efficiency (SE) and sensing accuracy, as well as reduce the latency. With the help of the extended Kalman filter (EKF), radar sensing is performed at the IBFD-IAB-nodes for the multi-vehicle scenario. Assuming the high power self-interference (SI) at the IBFD-IAB-node has been successfully canceled in the propagation, analog, and digital domains, only the residual SI is reserved in this work. Numerical results show that the closer the vehicle to the IAB-node, the higher the SE it can get. Compared with HD ISAC-IAB systems, our proposed IBFD ISAC-IAB systems can double the SE at the vehicle. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) are referred to as the quasi-dc current flows in power networks, driven by complex space weather-related phenomena. Such currents are a potential threat to the power delivery capability of electrical grids. To mitigate the detrimental impacts of GICs on critical infrastructures, the GICs should be monitored in power systems. Being inherently dc from the power frequency point of view, the components of GICs are, however, challenging and costly to monitor in ac power grids. This article puts forward a novel methodology for the real-time estimation of GICs in power transformers. Such aim is attained by means of an extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based approach, mounted on the nonlinear state-space model of the transformer, whose parameters can be derived from standard tests. The proposed EKF-based algorithm employs the available measurements for the transformer differential protection. The proposed approach, relying on the differential current, can properly deal with the external sources of interference like harmonic excitation and loading. The EKF-based estimator presented is validated by simulation and experimental data. The results verify the ability of the proposed approach to robustly estimate the GIC level during various operating conditions.  © 2021 IEEE.},

Only if the phase angle is accurately estimated, the energy transfer between the distributed power generators and the utility grid can be properly controlled. In this paper, we propose a particle filter (PF) based scheme to estimate the phase angle of the utility grid in the presence of voltage unbalance and frequency variation in the & alpha;β stationary reference frame where the positive and negative sequences of the input three-phase signal are separated by Clarke transformation. For the filter algorithm, the traditional SIR filter is customized for the grid synchronization problem by exploiting the feature of the grid state system dynamics and incorporating the deterministic resampling. Extensive simulations have been conducted to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed PF-based synchronization scheme. It is shown that the proposed PF-based scheme outperforms the traditional EKF-based scheme in terms of both estimation accuracy and convergence time, when both the voltage imbalance and frequency variation are exerted. © 2013 IEEE.},

A new small-signal model of the microgrid control system is developed, and a small-signal model-based information Kalman observer is introduced to acquire the estimated state vector. Then, the global closed-loop stochastic system accommodated by the Markov time-varying network-induced delays of the microgrid is derived, and the corresponding global stability theorem is introduced. Finally, the simulation of a microgrid test system is presented to verify the control performance. The results show that our approach has accurate regulations on voltage/frequency restoration and active power sharing in terms of load variations, plug-And-play capability, and network-induced delays.

	abstract = {This paper proposes a correlation-aided robust adaptive unscented Kalman filter (UKF) for power system decentralized dynamic state estimation with unknown inputs, termed as robust AUKF-UI. The temporal and spatial correlations among the unknown inputs are used to derive a vector auto-regressive (VAR) model in an adaptive manner. This VAR model is further integrated together with state transition and measurement models for joint state and unknown inputs estimation. This allows taking into account the implicit cross-correlations between the states and the unknown inputs. As a result, the rank requirement for unknown input vector estimation is relaxed and the local generator frequency measurement is not required. The temporal correlations of time series innovation vectors, predicted state and input vectors are also leveraged by the robust AUKF-UI to detect, identify and process bad data. Without these correlations, it is very challenging to address bad data with unknown inputs. Simulation results carried out on the IEEE 39-bus system demonstrate that, thanks to the use of hidden system temporal and spatial correlations, the proposed robust AUKF-UI has lower requirement of the number of measurements for dynamic state estimation while achieving better robustness against bad data as compared to the existing UKF methods with unknown inputs. © 1969-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Measured infield accelerometer data is very useful when evaluating the structural dynamics of any mechanical system. Researchers have great difficulty to make measurements from all particular regions where they are interested in due to shortage of measurement channels and difficulty of instrumentation. Thus the vibrations on the rest of the structure should be estimated with limited measured data. In this study a response acceleration estimation method based on input force estimation is employed. For estimation of applied forces and acceleration data form unmeasured locations of the structure, an accurate model of the system is required. Thus at first stages of the study, FE model is established and updated using experimental modal analysis results. Having the accurate dynamic model, vibration measurements of the structure are done under unknown forces to simulate operational conditions. To estimate applied load location, a state space model (SMM) of the structure is established using updated FE model. By employing augmented Kalman filter (AKF) approach, the location of the applied force is estimated from candidate force input locations, and the force signal is reconstructed. Knowing the force input location and the transfer function (TF) matrix of the structure, response acceleration power spectral density (PSD) data of the unmeasured locations can be estimated from measured locations. Employing Frequency Response Functions (FRFs) between excitation and measured location, PSD of the input force is obtained. Using input force PSD and FRF between excitation and unmeasured location, the unmeasured PSD data can be predicted. The methodology presented in this study is applied to the GARTEUR structure which is an internationally accepted de facto model. The FE model of the GARTEUR structure is set up first and subsequently the FE model is verified by modal tests. In the laboratory tests, GARTEUR structure is excited by impact hammer from an arbitrary location. Using the SMM of the GARTEUR and AKF approach, the location of the excitation force is estimated from candidate locations. After this step, PSD for the unmeasured locations are estimated from TF matrix of the structure and measured vibration data. Finally, both estimated and measured acceleration and force data are compared and satisfactory results are obtained. © Society for Experimental Mechanics, Inc. 2020.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a set of algorithms of granary robot is designed. The traditional outdoor localization technology is not suitable for indoor because of the shelter of the wall of the building. Traditional indoor localization technology has a poor effect because of the continuous change of terrain in barn. Compared with various indoor localization technologies, ultra wide band (UWB) localization technology has the advantages of strong penetration, low power consumption performance and high localization accuracy, but the problems of the system is a low updating frequency. Because of a low update frequency of UWB localization system, the paper presents a joint localization system which fuse Inertial-Measurement-Unit (IMU) inertial navigation system and the UWB localization system based on Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). It makes full use of the complementary features of the functions of the inertial localization system and the UWB localization system. The inertial localization system can continuously process the UWB localization information and it compensates the problem of a low refresh frequency of the UWB module, continuously optimizes the position and attitude in the dynamic process.

	abstract = {Fast synchronized measurements of the phasor, frequency, and rate of change of frequency are expected to be very important for the automated control actions in the smart grid context. In this regard, measurement latency must be kept as short as possible for an effective control implementation when networks characterized by extremely fast dynamics are concerned. Kalman filter (KF)-based estimation algorithms appear to be attractive in this context; however, the conventional implementations suffer from significant limitations in their ability to deal with different types of dynamic conditions due to approximations in the model and in the associated uncertainty. This article proposes an innovative solution, based on an extended KF algorithm using a Taylor model, which is shown to provide improved tracking ability in a vast range of dynamic conditions. A novel element in the proposed technique is the representation of model uncertainty, which takes into account the intrinsic correlation among errors that appear in the state-space description under dynamic conditions. A compatibility check between the forecast and measurement result is also introduced as an effective and metrologically sound approach to detect large unexpected changes in the tracked parameters in order to achieve a fast response of the algorithm also under those conditions. The performance of the algorithm is thoroughly investigated by means of simulation to demonstrate the significant improvement compared to other KF solutions in some conditions of practical relevance.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Dynamic state estimation is essential in case of various monitoring, control, and protection strategies that are designed based on the state-space model. Kalman filter-based estimation algorithms are mainly used to estimate these states locally using the input and output measurements of the generator. However, in the case of wide-area power system control and protection strategies, remote estimation of these states is required. This remote estimation relies upon phasor measurement units for measurement signals, which are limited to output measurements such as voltage, current, and frequency. For Kalman filter-based techniques, apart from the output, input measurements such as field and torque input are also required to estimate the states. This study proposes an input invariant filter technique using unbiased minimum variance filter and spherical simplex unscented transform for remote estimation of generator states using the limited phasor measurement unit measurements. The estimation is performed in the absence of mechanical input torque and field voltage measurements using a minimum set of sigma points. The performance of the filter under various transient conditions and in the presence of measurement errors are analysed and compared with existing techniques. © 2019 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.},

	abstract = {Dynamic state estimation (DSE) for generators plays an important role in power system monitoring and control. Phasor measurement unit (PMU) has been widely utilized in DSE since it can acquire real-time synchronous data with high sampling frequency. However, random noise is unavoidable in PMU data, which cannot be directly used as the reference data for power grid dispatching and control. Therefore, the data measured by PMU need to be processed. In this paper, an adaptive ensemble square root Kalman filter (AEnSRF) is proposed, in which the ensemble square root filter (EnSRF) and Sage-Husa algorithm are utilized to estimate measurement noise online. Simulation results obtained by applying the proposed method show that the estimation accuracy of AEnSRF is better than that of ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), and AEnSRF can track the measurement noise when the measurement noise changes. © 2019 by the authors.

The observed GPS pseudo-range varies from the true range because of range measurement errors. GPS errors sources are ionospheric delays, atmospheric delays, troposphericelays, multi-path effects and dilution of precision etc., affecting the GPS signals as they travel from satellite to user on Earth. In this paper neural models has been presented are for more accurate GPS timing in electric power systems with a singlefrequencyGPS receiver. The proposed methods use back-propagation (BP), extendedKalman filter (EKF) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) training algorithms, which achieves the optimal training criterion. We use actual data to evaluate the performance of the proposed methods. An experimental test setup is designed and implemented for this purpose. Results using the threemethods are discussed. The experimental results obtained from a coarse acquisition (C/A)-code single-frequency GPS receiver are provided to confirm the efficacy of the approaches to give high accurate timing.

	abstract = {This paper introduces the reader to our Kalman filter developed for geodetic VLBI (very long baseline interferometry) data analysis. The focus lies on the EOP (Earth Orientation Parameter) determination based on the Continuous VLBI Campaign 2014 (CONT14) data, but also earlier CONT campaigns are analyzed. For validation and comparison purposes we use EOP determined with the classical LSM (least squares method) estimated from the same VLBI data set as the Kalman solution with a daily resolution. To gain higher resolved EOP from LSM we run solutions which yield hourly estimates for polar motion and dUT1 = Universal Time (UT1) – Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). As an external validation data set we use a GPS (Global Positioning System) solution providing hourly polar motion results. Further, we describe our approach for determining the noise driving the Kalman filter. It has to be chosen carefully, since it can lead to a significant degradation of the results. We illustrate this issue in context with the de-correlation of polar motion and nutation. Finally, we find that the agreement with respect to GPS can be improved by up to 50% using our filter compared to the LSM approach, reaching a similar precision than the GPS solution. Especially the power of erroneous high-frequency signals can be reduced dramatically, opening up new possibilities for high-frequency EOP studies and investigations of the models involved in VLBI data analysis. We prove that the Kalman filter is more than on par with the classical least squares method and that it is a valuable alternative, especially on the advent of the VLBI2010 Global Observing System and within the GGOS frame work. © 2017 Institute of Seismology, China Earthquake Administration},

The improved state-extended model increases the system robustness, adaptive notch filters decrease the influence of harmonic signals. Through four simulation comparisons, the new algorithm's influence on mutation of frequency and amplitude is smaller, harmonic's influence on tracking performance is smaller, with its tracking performance is better than the algorithm in literature[12] under the condition that frequency changed slowly.

A recent solution based on a coexistence paradigm offers some RFI- free durations for RAS but further expansion of RAS observation faces with strong RFI. To enhance spectrum access opportunities for both wireless communications and RAS, we explore a new approach where both systems simultaneously access the spectrum for some durations and RAS exploits RFI cancellation. The main challenge is nonlinear distortion caused by strong RFI. We study this nonlinearity's effect on RAS observation performance and develop a nonlinear-RFI cancellation scheme and a modified RAS signal power estimation scheme. We also design a channel estimator for the nonlinear system based on the unscented Kalman filter. Simulation results in flat stationary channels and multipath Rayleigh fading channels show the proposed approach yields a great improvement in RAS signal power estimation performance even at strong RFI levels. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The frequency-domain adaptive filter (FDAF) is widely used in echo cancellation systems due to its low complexity and fast convergence rate. However, the FDAF algorithm with a fixed step size exhibits a tradeoff among the convergence rate, steady-state misalignment, tracking ability, and robustness to near-end speech interferences. Several variable step-size FDAF algorithms were presented to address this problem. However, the state-of-the-art variable step-size FDAF algorithms did not handle this problem comprehensively. This paper presents a new robust variable step-size control approach to the FDAF algorithm. Based on a statistical analysis of the FDAF algorithm, an optimal step size for each frequency bin is derived by minimizing the mean-square deviation (MSD) between the true weight vector and estimated weight vector at each frame. Calculation of the step size requires the system distance and the observation noise power spectral density (PSD). The system distance is estimated using the deterministic recursive equations of MSD and the noise PSD is computed using the magnitude squared coherence function between the far-end signal and error signal. Moreover, a close link between the proposed FDAF and the frequency-domain Kalman filter is revealed. Specifically, the work presented here can be understood as a means to adaptively monitor and control the underlying acoustic state space of the Kalman filter, including means for fast readaptation of the adaptive filter after abrupt echo path changes. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve fast convergence and low steady-state misalignment. Furthermore, the algorithm is robust to the double-talk interferences, but it does not require an explicit double-talk detector. © 2017 IEEE.},

Then, this model is used in a Kalman filter (KF) to estimate the system state-space variables. Even though the states estimation do not match the variables of the real system, it has allowed to design three sliding-mode controllers providing the following features to the closed-loop system: 1) robustness due to the fact that control specifications are met independently of any variation in the system parameters; 2) noise immunity, since a KF is applied; 3) a lower total harmonic distortion (THD) of the current delivered by the grid compared with the standard solution using measured variables; 4) the fundamental component of the voltage at the point of common coupling is estimated even in the case of a distorted grid; and 5) a reduction in the number of sensors. Thanks to this solution, the sliding surfaces for each controller are independent. This decoupling property of the three controllers allows using a fixed switching-frequency algorithm that ensures a perfect current control. Finally, experimental results validate the proposed control strategy and illustrate all its interesting features. © 2016 IEEE.},

Recently, requirements have emerged for real-time accurate orbit determination at sub-meter level in order to carry out onboard geocoding of high-resolution imagery, open-loop operation of altimeters and radio occultation. This study proposes an improved real-time kinematic positioning method for LEO satellites using single-frequency receivers. The C/A code and L1 phase are combined to eliminate ionospheric effects. The epoch-differenced carrier phase measurements are utilized to acquire receiver position changes which are further used to smooth the absolute positions. A kinematic Kalman filter is developed to implement kinematic orbit determination. Actual flight data from China’s small satellite SJ-9A are used to test the navigation performance. Results show that the proposed method outperforms traditional kinematic positioning method in terms of accuracy.

	abstract = {Model validation is an essential task to determine whether a model can accurately describe the actual behaviours of a power system. Currently, major commercial software tools are equipped with an 'event playback' function to validate dynamic models using testing data from phasor measurement units (PMUs). Due to their limited bandwidth and low sampling rates, PMUs cannot capture the fast-Transient dynamics. As such, the playback function using the conventional approach may mistakenly invalidate an accurate model during the high-frequency responses. To overcome the deficiency, a batch state estimation approach is proposed in this study to improve the performance of the 'event playback' function by focusing on lowfrequency responses in model validation. The proposed approach consists of three major steps. First, a multi-model adaptive Kalman filter approach is used to estimate the dynamic states of the system. Second, the singular spectrum analysis (SSA) is used to detect the fault clearance time. Finally, the estimated states after the fault are used as the initial states of the 'event playback' to validate the dynamic model during the low-frequency responses. The analytical basis of the proposed method is also provided by showing the existence and uniqueness of the trajectory of the underlying model. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated using the PSS/E. © 2020 Institution of Engineering and Technology. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The battery system is one of the most-important, but also -critical components in the electric power-train. The battery’s system states and parameters are commonly tracked by the battery monitoring system. However, in reality, the accuracy of the state and parameter estimation may suffer from insufficient excitation of the system. Since the current states and parameters serve as the basis for many battery management system functions, this might lead to incorrect operation and severe damage. Reconfigurable battery systems allow enhancing the system’s excitation by applying a switching operation. In this contribution, the state and parameter estimation of a reconfigurable battery module were simulated and tested experimentally. Thereby, a low-exciting and a high-exciting drive cycle were compared. Furthermore, the switching patterns were applied to enhance the excitation and, hence, improve the estimation of an extended Kalman filter. The cells were switched via a pulse-width modulation signal, and the influence of frequency and duty cycle variation on the estimation accuracy were investigated. Compared to the low-excitation input, a significant improvement in the estimation of up to (Formula presented.) for the state of charge and (Formula presented.) for the internal resistance were achieved. Hereby, low frequencies and duty cycles proved to be particularly advantageous. Switching, however, has only a limited influence on an already highly excited system and may lead to additional aging due to higher heat generation. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates a sliding mode control for a wind turbine in finite frequency (FFSMC). The sliding mode control (SMC) method can be designed for wind energy conversion systems. However, the fluctuations of wind speed perhaps reduce the robustness of the SMC. A dynamic compensator is introduced to design the sliding surface in order to overcome the difficulty of dealing with a fluctuation of wind speed, but the fast change of this fluctuation in certain finite ranges can lead to degrade the compensator performance. In order to solve this problem, a finite frequency approach based on the generalised Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov (KYP) lemma is proposed, and the compensator parameters are obtained in terms of linear matrix inequality (LMI) which can be solved efficiently using existing numerical tools. On the other hand, the reaching law is used to reduce the chattering that is produced by the traditional approach of sliding mode. Finally, the simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy compared to a non-singular terminal sliding mode control.

	abstract = {Machine tools are for machining a workpiece by a tool. The main components of machine tools are the frame, the power unit, the control and the steering. The position of the tool should be stabilized at the zero position by the control, which is typically a pure feedback control. The power unit realizes the movement of the workpiece. Thereby, large accelerations of the workpiece must be realized in order to increase the economic efficiency. The periodic movement of the workpiece respectively the power unit excites the entire machine tool and ultimately the tool itself resulting in a position error signal containing the frequencies from the movement. Since the motion pattern of the workpiece is customer knowledge, the frequencies it contains are not known in advance. Additionally, the frequencies change over time due to different motion patterns. However, the range in which the frequencies lie is known. In high-precision positioning of machine tools, there are three possibilities to reduce position errors of the tool: reduction of the disturbance causing the errors, optimization of the plant, which is the whole machine tool, or the control. This contribution focuses on the optimization of the control. By adding active disturbance rejection to the existing feedback controller for the tool, the influence of the disturbance on the position error of the tool is reduced. The resulting controller contains a disturbance estimator based on a Kalman filter. Hereby, the system, which shall be estimated, is either modelled as MIMO system or as a decoupled SISO system. A comparison between the SISO and MIMO realization leads to opposing requirements regarding the parameter tuning and the performance. However, the controller reduces the position error in both cases drastically even under the influence of sensor noise and mismatches between the plant and the system included in the filter. In summary, our approach permits us to estimate disturbances evolving from periodic movements of the workpiece and reduce their impact on the position error signal of the tool. This reduction translates directly into improved machine tool overall performance. © 2023 Euspen Headquarters.},

The noticeable popularity of WSNs has imposed enlarged computational in-node demands. Hence, the recourse to fully-integrated and sophisticated systems with low power is a challenging task. Since wireless sensor nodes have limited power resources, it is important to find a balance between energy consumption and computational performance. The traditional software optimizations are not usually suited or enough to find this tradeoff. Consequently, the use of codesign methodology and the careful implementation of hardware accelerator with low frequency processors could offer a good compromise between energy consumption and performance. In this paper, we present a SoC WSN node prototype based on Leon 3 processor for leak detection in water pipeline using Kalman Filter (KF). A hardware acceleration of the KF has been designed and implemented to reduce energy consumption. We have compared also the software implementation of the algorithm and its hardware acceleration in terms of the execution time, the energy consumption and the area requirements. The results show about 97% reduction in energy consumption and execution time without noticeable increased area. © 2019 IEEE.},

Based on the noise characteristics of OCTs, such as overlapping signals, noise frequency bands, low signal-to-noise ratios, and difficulties in acquiring statistical features of noise power, an improved standard Kalman filtering algorithm was proposed for direct current (DC) signal processing. The state-space model of the OCT DC measurement system is first established, and then mixed noise can be processed by adding mixed noise into measurement and state parameters. According to the minimum mean squared error criterion, state predictions and update equations of the improved Kalman algorithm could be deduced based on the established model. An improved central difference Kalman filter was proposed for alternating current (AC) signal processing, which improved the sampling strategy and noise processing of colored noise. Real-time estimation and correction of noise were achieved by designing AC and DC noise recursive filters. Experimental results show that the improved signal processing algorithms had a good filtering effect on the AC and DC signals with mixed noise of OCT. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm was able to achieve real-time correction of noise during the OCT filtering process. © 2017 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).},

	abstract = {This paper proposes an online decentralized and data-driven method for synchronous generator rotor speed and inertia estimation. First, an analytical relationship between the generator terminal voltage/current phasors and its internal rotor speed is derived using the Thevenin equivalent. The parameters of the latter are obtained via a recursive estimator, which allows us to estimate the generator's internal rotor speed from voltage/current phasors without the need for any generator information. Second, we reformulate the equivalent swing equation into the Kalman filter form, which enables us to use a priori-estimated internal rotor speed along with measured real and reactive power injections to obtain an estimate of the inertia for each online synchronous generator. This is achieved through an adaptive unscented Kalman filter. We demonstrate that the use of terminal bus frequency to approximate the rotor speed for inertia estimation by existing methods leads to large estimation biases/errors. Numerical simulations carried out on the IEEE 39-bus and Texas 2000-bus systems reveal that our proposed method is consistently more accurate than existing methods. Moreover, our proposed method is insensitive to both the type and location of system disturbances, and it is robust to different levels of measurement noise. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Recently with the large-scale access of renewable energy into power system through power electronics, distributed energy systems attract more attention. However, low inertia decreases the voltage or frequency stability and anti-disturbance capability of systems, causing power quality is vulnerable to the intermittency and uncertainty in photovoltaics or wind plants. Therefore, the virtual inertia control (VIC) is proposed to maintain system stability. This paper proposes a virtual adaptive inertia control (VAIC) strategy. The states of energy storage battery packs (ESBPs) are estimated online by the dual extended Kalman filter. Then the virtual inertia and droop parameters are designed through the fuzzy logic and virtual battery algorithms based on battery states and bus voltage fluctuations, aiming at distributing inertia and power in the dynamic and steady periods respectively. The stability is analyzed using the small signal model, and its feasibility is verified on the Matlab/Simulink platform. In microgrids with multiple ESBPs, the VAIC distributes power and inertia among ESBPs considering their different capabilities of power supplying and the system requirement for inertia. It can suppress the voltage fluctuations, improve the system stability, and achieve the decentralized and coordinated control during the whole running process of microgrid. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The concept of a phasor synchronized was introduced in the 1980s and standardized for the first time with the standard IEEE 1344-1995 revised in IEEE C37.118-2005, that defined performance for compliance in steady state. In the last revision the standard has been split into: Standard for Syncrophasor Measurements IEEE C37.118.1 that defines the requirements that characterized the dynamic performance, and Standard for Synchrophasor Data Transfer IEEE C37.118.2 to harmonize it with the IEC 61850 Standard. The Kalman filter is an efficient recursive algorithm that estimates the current state variables and their uncertainties from a series of measurements perturbed by Gaussian noise. The algorithm works in a two-step process: the prediction step and the correction step. Because of the algorithm's recursive nature, it can run in real time using only the present input measurements and the previously calculated state. The Kalman filter has been used in a wide range of engineering and econometric applications. Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU) can sample the sinusoidal waveforms and estimate a synchrophasor equivalent. Synchrophasor are generally calculated from waveform using a discrete Fourier transform (DFT). DFT-based techniques provide simple, elegant and accurate estimation but there are alternative algorithms. In this paper it's studied the application of Kalman filter to improve synchrophasor measurement algorithms for optimal tracking of power system voltage phasors and frequency. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated under a variety of conditions including static state and dynamic state following the tests proposed in the new standard IEEE C37.118.1-2011. It can be seen that the algorithm achieves good dynamic performance when exposed to signal oscillations, the outputs track the step amplitude and step phase changes in inputs, it shows frequency tracking capability and it's well suited for noisy measurements. © 2013 CIGRE.

Unlike the traditional approaches, we suggest transmitting a non-linearily ampliied signal without any il-tering and addressing the OFDM sample estimation from the distorted signal at the receiver. The proposed post-distortion and detection technique is based on a Volterra model for the PA and the channel. As the transmission can switch from one sub-band to another, the CR-PA behavior varies over time and the Volterra kernels can be constant or suddenly change. Therefore, an interactive multiple model (IMM) combining extended Kalman filters is considered. The transition probability matrix, which plays a key role in the IMM, is also sequentially estimated. The resulting uplink system has various advantages: it learns from the observations and a part of the computational load is exported to the receiver, which is not battery driven unlike the mobile terminal. © 2015 EURASIP.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a model-based control technique to provide the contribution of wind power generators to primary frequency regulation in electric power systems. Models of individual wind power generators and wind farm (WF) as a whole are presented and the proposed control strategy is detailed. It consists of a central controller, a central Kalman filter (KF), and some local KFs, one for each wind turbine. The central controller is disabled in normal operation conditions and its task is to set the power reference for each wind turbine, overwriting the local reference, when a disturbance occurs. Central KF is in charge of estimating the external load variation, while each local KF estimates wind speed and the wind turbines dynamical state. The key feature of this approach is that each wind turbine can react to grid disturbances in a different way, which depends on wind speed as seen by the wind turbine itself and by its dynamical conditions. Real wind data and a large WF connected to the grid in a dedicated simulation environment have been used to test the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy. © 2010-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {A promising approach to avoid the bottleneck of the analog-to-digital converter's (ADCs) high power consumption at high sampling frequencies is to use only 1-bit quantization resolution. By using temporal oversampling at the receiver, a high resolution in the time-domain can be achieved, which can partly recover the losses in terms of rate caused by a reduced amplitude resolution. However, channel estimation and synchronization has to be performed on 1-bit quantized receive samples, which poses a new challenge.This work is concerned with the phase estimation of a 1-bit quantized system with phase noise in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) range. A block-based least squares (LS) estimator, whose output is interpolated by a Kalman filter is presented to track the phase noise. To enhance the performance, especially for the case of a large spacing between pilot blocks, we study the Rauch-Tung-Striebel (RTS) algorithm. Both algorithms are adjusted to the system characteristics and bounds for the steady state performance are derived. These bounds, as well as numerical results show that the RTS algorithm achieves a lower error variance than the Kalman filter at the price of increased latency, as it is non-causal. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {State-of-charge (SOC) estimation is a core technology for battery management systems. Considerable progress has been achieved in the study of SOC estimation algorithms, especially the algorithm on the basis of Kalman filter to meet the increasing demand of model-based battery management systems. The Kalman filter weakens the influence of white noise and initial error during SOC estimation but cannot eliminate the existing error of the battery model itself. As such, the accuracy of SOC estimation is directly related to the accuracy of the battery model. Thus far, the quantitative relationship between model accuracy and model-based SOC estimation remains unknown. This study summarizes three equivalent circuit lithium-ion battery models, namely, Thevenin, PNGV, and DP models. The model parameters are identified through hybrid pulse power characterization test. The three models are evaluated, and SOC estimation conducted by EKF-Ah method under three operating conditions are quantitatively studied. The regression and correlation of the standard deviation and normalized RMSE are studied and compared between the model error and the SOC estimation error. These parameters exhibit a strong linear relationship. Results indicate that the model accuracy affects the SOC estimation accuracy mainly in two ways: dispersion of the frequency distribution of the error and the overall level of the error. On the basis of the relationship between model error and SOC estimation error, our study provides a strategy for selecting a suitable cell model to meet the requirements of SOC precision using Kalman filter. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

The mass of a helicopter is augmented to the state vector, and the augmented state vector forms a nonlinear system.

A simulation and offline data processing are done to verify the efficiency of the estimations. Furthermore, Self-Tuning PID Controller is designed. Once PID gains are tuned, Self-Tuning PID Controller tunes these gains automatically in response to the mass variation.

The proposed Kalman filter-based beamformer is compared with the Least Mean Squares (LMS) and the Recursive Least Squares (RLS) techniques under various parameter regimes, and the results reveal the superior performance of the proposed approach in terms of beamforming stability, Half-Power Beam Width (HPBW), maximum Side-Lobe Level (SLL), null depth at the direction of interference signals, and convergence rate for different Signal to Interference (SIR) values. Also, the results demonstrate that the suggested approach not only achieves perfect adaptation of the radiation pattern synthesis at high jamming power, but also keep the same SLL at different operating frequencies.

	abstract = {Measurement of motor position and speed has always been a problem due to limited resources and costs in industrial servo drive systems since the non-linear behavior of low-resolution and low-cost encoders, estimation of motor speed with conventional methods, and disturbances in wide frequency ranges in the servo system reduce the performance of the motion control system. Thus, for the last few decades, the main goal in motion control system design has become to assure that the highest quality could be achieved by increasing robustness for various torque disturbances, system noises, and uncertainties present in the drive system. This paper proposes the filter form of state observer to estimate the permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) state variables, which ensures a fast and accurate estimation to enhance the performance of the motion control system. The proposed filter in this paper has been compared with the state observer and pulse count method, which are two popular methods in motor control applications, by conducting mathematical analysis and simulation study. Results gathered from these analysis conclude that an improvement on the time delay of estimation algorithm could very well be achieved.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The goal of this paper is to develop an observer-based disturbance rejection electric power steering (EPS) controller to provide steering assistance and improve the driver's steering feel. For the purpose of control design, a control-oriented model of a vehicle with a column-assist EPS system is developed and verified against a high-fidelity multibody dynamics model of the vehicle. The high-fidelity model is used to mimic vehicle dynamics to study controller performance in realistic driving conditions. Then, a linear quadratic Gaussian approach is used to design an EPS optimal controller, in which a Kalman filter estimates the unmeasured steering system's states and external disturbance. A new formulation for the linear quadratic regulator objective function is proposed to take advantages of the known information about the system dynamics to attenuate the disturbance and magnify the driver's torque. Finally, the EPS controller is applied to the high-fidelity vehicle model in a software-in-the-loop simulation to evaluate its robustness and performance under realistic conditions. The results show that the proposed controller can effectively reduce the disturbance induced in the steering rack, and simultaneously magnify the driver's steering torque by use of a bi-linear EPS characteristic curve. Then, to show the disturbance rejection properties of this EPS controller, its performance is compared with H2/H∞ and PID control designs using time and frequency domain analysis. © Institution of Mechanical Engineers.},

In the presence of power electronic converter interfaced loads that can display high-bandwidth constant power load (CPL) behavior, the nonlinearity of the negative incremental resistance can induce instability. This paper employs a local and switched affine model for buck converters interfacing the generation units. Load behavior and system interaction are modelled via a virtual disturbance approach and included as an additional state in an augmented local Kalman filter (ALKF). Stored energy in inductor and capacitor are used to derive a Lyapunov function defining stability regions for the switching states and subsequently a switching rule ensuring quadratic stability is chosen. The simulation of an exemplary system shows how voltage stability is achieved. The controller is then further extended to avoid steady-state errors and limit the converters switching frequency. © 2017 IEEE.},

Unlike the traditional control techniques for rectifiers, the proposed method uses a cascade dual-model-predictive control for the inner and outer control loops. The three-phase currents of the rectifier are controlled with the inner control loop, while the desired output voltage is achieved with the outer control loop. In this proposal, the output power is used as a feedforward to enhance the transient dynamics of the output dc voltage. Several advantages can be highlighted such as a fixed switching frequency, and output voltage variations are avoided when a sudden change in the load or a voltage sag appears. The overall control proposal has been fully integrated into a digital signal processor.

	abstract = {An accurate and reliable positioning system (PS) is a significant topic of research due to its broad range of aerospace applications, such as the localization of autonomous agents in GPS-denied and indoor environments. The PS discussed in this work uses ultra-wide band (UWB) sensors to provide distance measurements. UWB sensors are based on radio frequency technology and offer low power consumption, wide bandwidth, and precise ranging in the presence of nominal environmental noise. However, in practical situations, UWB sensors experience varying measurement noise due to unexpected obstacles in the environment. The localization accuracy is highly dependent on the filtering of such noise, and the extended Kalman filter (EKF) is one of the widely used techniques. In varying noise situations, where the obstacles generate larger measurement noise than nominal levels, EKF cannot offer precise results. Therefore, this work proposes two approaches based on EKF: sequential adaptive EKF and piecewise adaptive EKF. Simulation studies are conducted in static, linear, and nonlinear scenarios, and it is observed that higher accuracy is achieved by applying the proposed approaches as compared to the traditional EKF method. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {With the development of portable navigation gadgets, power-saving becomes a competitive factor for both mass-market products and dedicated ones. Considering a deep GNSS/INS integrated navigation system as background, on the receiver side, based on previous work, a Quasi-Kalman is proposed as pre-filter inside the tracking channel, which can provide accurate parameters estimation including code delay, frequency, and carrier phase. While one the INS side, only a low-pass filter is used in Dead-Reckoning process to facilitate the evaluation of power-saving strategy. With respect to the intermittent working pattern, a new duty-cycle strategy taking advantage of INS is proposed and tested in real scenario, the main highlight of the new proposed strategy is that the initialization of tracking process in every wake-up exploits the information provided by INS, which can largely extend the sleep period to save the energy without impacting the normal working of the integrated system. The result shows that the validity of the proposed power-saving strategy, with the setting of the experiment, it can save the energy up to 80% only considering the GNSS receiver. Meanwhile, it can be concluded that the setting of sleep period and active period mainly depends on the quality of IMU. Finally, the future work including the hardware implementation and in-depth analysis of the deep GNSS/INS integrated system is also proposed. Copyright © (2017) by Institute of Navigation.

However, it increases the system complexity and vulnerability to cyberattacks that could jeopardize the seamless system operation. The attack must be detected effectively, and then proper measures to mitigate the effect quickly to restore normality. This work implements a reduced-order H∞ filter to simultaneously estimate the state variable and unknown inputs such as noise or attack signals in the automatic generation control (AGC) system. Further, the knowledge of the disturbances is utilized to mitigate the attack by appropriately compensating the sensor readings, such that the control decisions are based on the correct states, not the corrupted signals generated in the attack scenario. The stability criterion is provided based on Lyapunov functions to check the estimation error in the presence of the exogenous disturbance. Further, the proposed H∞ estimator performance is evaluated by comparing it with the Kalman filter to verify its effectiveness. The estimator's performance is validated by developing a cosimulation platform using the server-client architecture of data exchange. Further, the performance is validated in a real-time digital simulator (RTDS) platform used as the power system interacting with an estimator deployed on Raspberry Pi board sensing the attacks.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Single Carrier Frequency Division Multiple Access (SC-FDMA) has been adopted for 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Long Term Evolution (LTE) uplink communication since it combines the low peak to average power ratio feature of single-carrier transmission systems with the multipath resistance and flexible frequency allocation of orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA). Unfortunately, SC-FDMA transmission over time-varying multipath fading channels for very high speed environments the subcarrier orthogonality is destroyed giving rise to intercarrier interference (ICI) due to channel variation within an SC-FDMA symbol. This paper is, therefore, focused on the use of time-domain channel interpolator for LTE uplink systems in large Doppler spread scenarios to improve channel tracking performance. The resulting interpolation algorithm is based on the discrete prolate spheroidal wave functions (DPSWF) which is particularly well suited to represent the rapidly time-varying fading channel due to optimum finite time and frequency support feature. The variations of the channel taps are tracked first by a Kalman filter in time domain during training symbols. Then, a DPSWF based channel interpolator is applied to recover the time variation of channel taps between training symbols within two consecutive slots in a single subframe. The performance of the proposed interpolator is compared with a polynomial interpolator whose order is adjusted adaptively to achieve the best fit under particular user mobilities. Moreover, the analytical mean square error (MSE) performance of DPSWF is derived and compared with the simulations. The results show that the DPSWF represents the time-varying fading channel very effectively and the proposed algorithm has excellent channel estimation performance in high SNR even with a very small number of channel interpolation parameters employed in the algorithm. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {We build on a long-standing tradition in astronomical adaptive optics (AO) of specifying performance metrics and error budgets using linear systems modeling in the spatial-frequency domain. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive tool for the calculation of error budgets in terms of residual temporally filtered phase power spectral densities and variances. In addition, the fast simulation of AO-corrected point spread functions (PSFs) provided by this method can be used as inputs for simulations of science observations with next-generation instruments and telescopes, in particular to predict post-coronagraphic contrast improvements for planet finder systems. We extend the previous results presented in Correia and Teixeira [J. Opt. Soc. Am. A 31, 2763 (2014)] to the closed-loop case with predictive controllers and generalize the analytical modeling of Rigaut et al. [Proc. SPIE 3353, 1038 (1998)], Flicker [Technical Report (W. M. Keck Observatory, 2007)], and Jolissaint [J. Eur. Opt. Soc. 5, 10055 (2010)]. We follow closely the developments of Ellerbroek [J. Opt. Soc. Am. A 22, 310 (2005)] and propose the synthesis of a distributed Kalman filter to mitigate both aniso-servo-lag and aliasing errors while minimizing the overall residual variance. We discuss applications to (i) analytic AO-corrected PSF modeling in the spatial-frequency domain, (ii) post-coronagraphic contrast enhancement, (iii) filter optimization for real-time wavefront reconstruction, and (iv) PSF reconstruction from system telemetry. Under perfect knowledge of wind velocities, we show that ~60 nm rms error reduction can be achieved with the distributed Kalman filter embodying antialiasing reconstructors on 10 m class high-order AO systems, leading to contrast improvement factors of up to three orders of magnitude at few λ/D separations (~1 − 5λ/D) for a 0 magnitude star and reaching close to one order of magnitude for a 12 magnitude star. © 2017 Optical Society of America.},

	abstract = {Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) systems based on single radio frequency (RF) receiver have been shown to achieve high data rates due to the exploitation of spatial diversity with the use of multiple antennas at the transmitters and/or receivers. However, exploiting the full multiplexing gain of the MIMO channel requires a RF front end and analog to digital converters for each antenna to process each data stream at baseband, which implies an increase in hardware size, cost computation, and power consumption with respect to single-input-single-output (SISO) systems. This technique can be great, which we can not get the additional diversity gain using the linear MIMO decomposition method. The resulting performance trends showed a significant increase when compared to MIMO-OFDM schemes using conventional antenna. But the complexity of computational cost is high, especially for the larger antenna size. For that we propose to reduce the complexity of computation cost hence technology of a RF signal processing for MIMO-OFDM can reliable applied. In this research we proposes a technique to reduce complexity of computational cost using Kalman filter as MIMO equalizer. In this technique we perform the reduction of the larger matrix size into lower matrix size. In additional part we use an error correction coding (ECC) technique using convolution code and Viterbi algorithm decoding applied at receiver side. Computer simulation result showed that our proposed scheme give low computation. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {A sliding-mode control (SMC) technology is widely used in inductor-capacitor-inductor (LCL)-filtered grid-tied inverters (GTIs) due to its strong robustness against parameter drift. However, under weak grid conditions, the steady performance of GTI using conventional pulsewidth-modulation-based SMC (PWM-SMC) degrades, resulting in increased harmonics in grid-injected currents. One reason is that the voltage feedforward term at the point of common coupling (PCC) in the SMC loop causes the phase margin of the inverter output impedance to decrease. Another reason is that the gain of conventional PWM-SMC-based systems is not high enough, especially under weak grid conditions. This article proposes a PCC feedforward voltage reconstruction method (named KF-PWM-SMC) for a PWM-SMC-based controller using Kalman filter (KF) estimation. As a result, the phase and magnitude of the inverter output impedance at the desired frequency can be significantly improved. Moreover, the proposed PCC feedforward voltage extraction method can save the PCC voltage control sensor, thereby improving the reliability of the whole system. A 3-kW experimental GTI based on the dSPACE DS1202 platform has been developed to verify the feasibility of the proposed control strategy.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Because it uses a set of model integrations to simulate the temporally varying background probability distribution function and implement Bayes' theorem, the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), which produces an optimal data assimilation solution that coherently combines model dynamics and observational information, has been widely used in weather and climate studies. However, in practice, the EnKF has two limitations: (1) the insufficient representation of error statistics of low-frequency background flows due to its finite ensemble size and model integration over time and (2) the high demand of computational power for ensemble model integrations in high-resolution coupled Earth system models. Given that background error statistics consist of stationary, slow-varying, and fast-varying parts, a multi-timescale, high-efficiency approximate EnKF (MSHea-EnKF) is designed to increase the representation of low-frequency background error statistics and enhance its computational efficiency. The MSHea-EnKF is a combination of multi-timescale filters implemented by regressions based on data sampled from the time series of a single-model solution. Validation shows that with the improved representation of stationary and slow-varying background statistics, the MSHea-EnKF only requires a small fraction of computer resources and shows a comparable performance relative to a finite size EnKF. Our experiments also show that the result can be further improved by using a small set of MSHea-EnKFs through second-stage EnKF filtering if sufficient computer resources are available. This new algorithm makes it practical to assimilate multisource observations into any high-resolution coupled Earth system model that is intractable with current computing power for weather-climate analysis and predictions. ©2018.

	abstract = {Modern power grids are rapidly shifting from fossil fuel-based generation to carbon-free renewable sources. This transition brings the problem of balancing power supply and demand to a higher level-due largely to the high uncertainty of renewable generation such as wind and solar. Aggregations of thermostatically controlled loads such as residential air conditioners (AC) can provide balancing services by leveraging the thermal inertia of houses. Existing work has focused on single-zone houses; however, a significant fraction of houses have more than one zone. In these houses a single AC provides cooling to multiple distinct areas each with their own thermostat. Moreover, air temperature dynamics are coupled across zones. In this paper we propose a mathematical model describing the dynamical behavior of two-zone ACs and develop the corresponding aggregate system model. In addition, we also design non-disruptive aggregate control strategies-called the uniform and priority controllers-to perform frequency regulation services and investigate different Kalman Filter-based state estimation approaches to reduce real-time information needs. It is revealed from numerical simulations that the uniform controller yields the best power tracking performance while the priority controller is able to minimize the total ACs cycles, though it requires more computation time.  © 2022 American Automatic Control Council.},

To sense PUs activities, channel gain estimation is performed by CRs through space-time extended Kalman filtering (STEKF). The STEKF method captures the channel gain from any point in space to each CR at each frame for a specific range of frequencies. The proposed channel gain tracking enables CRs to detect the transmit power, location and the number of active subcarriers of each PU via a time spatial weighted non-negative Lasso (TSWNL) algorithm. The TSWNL exploits the sparsity of the PUs activities in a geographical area to track PUs activities in frequency-selective fading channels. Numerical results indicate that the proposed spectrum sensing based on STEKF significantly improves the performance of CRs in tracking of PUs activities. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2013.},

An adaptive algorithm for finding appropriate parameter K of VMD is used to ensure that there is no false mode in the VMD result.

However, the carrier frequency offset (CFO) causing synchronization problem is very important for GFDM system. In this paper, we propose a turbo receiver with channel estimation, equalization and CFO compensation for MIMO (multiple input multiple output) GFDM system with index modulation (IM). So far, no related researches exist. This paper proposes a novel receiver to solve CFO compensation with two-path transmission and proposes a modified phase rotated conjugate cancellation (PRCC) algorithm for the receiver. On the other hand, GFDM with index modulation (GFDM-IM) can achieve better performance and lower peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) than those of GFDM by using active index subcarrier. To reduce the system complexity, the log-likelihood ratio (LLR) criteria is also employed to search which subcarrier is active. Moreover, the Kalman filter is employed to trace the time-varying channels. The initial channel estimation is performed by the sparse pilot signals. In the simulations, we compare the proposed receiver with several existing schemes in different time-varying channels and modulations. The proposed scheme outperforms the existing schemes. © 2018 Elsevier GmbH},

This study presents a methodology to extract meaningful information from each segment of a disturbance signal. In the approach described in this study, the segmentation is performed by an extended complex Kalman filter. The main features extracted from each segment are symmetrical components at fundamental frequency of voltage and current signals. Feature extraction uses root-mean-square values to obtain the symmetrical components of the three phase quantities. This methodology focuses on offline analysis of fault recorder data of power generators and it is developed not only to fault analysis, but also to verify normal operational procedures, from which result most of the disturbance records. This study also describes an expert system that can be used to automatically classify each record into known categories, focusing the engineer's attention to the most relevant occurrences. © 2015.

	abstract = {Estimation error and high frequency ripple in the traditional sliding-mode observer control of a PMSM are problems for which this paper proposes a method of combining the extended Kalman filter with an improved sliding mode observer to replace the traditional one. First, the error between the estimated stator current and the actual value and the back-EMF are calculated according to the mathematical model of the sliding mode observer of PMSM. Then, the output variables are calculated according to the EKF state equation of the motor, which realizes on-line parameter adjustment and reduces parameter estimation errors, thereby improving steady-state and dynamic performance of the system. Finally, a simulation and hardware experimental platform are built to verify the proposed method. The results show that the optimized sliding mode observer control reduces the chattering of the system. System disturbance is reduced by 70% when the voltage parameters of the regulator are changed, and the method enables the PMSM to have better reliability and tracking performance. © 2021 Power System Protection and Control Press.},

	abstract = {The current trend of the civil aviation technology is to modernize the legacy air traffic control (ATC) system that is mainly supported by many ground based navigation aids to be the new air traffic management (ATM) system that is enabled by global positioning system (GPS) technology. Due to the low receiving power of GPS signal, it is a major concern to aviation authorities that the operation of the ATM system might experience service interruption when the GPS signal is jammed by either intentional or unintentional radio-frequency interference. To maintain the normal operation of the ATM system during the period of GPS outage, the use of the current radar system is proposed in this paper. However, the tracking performance of the current radar system could not meet the required performance of the ATM system, and an enhanced tracking algorithm, the interacting multiple model and probabilistic data association filter (IMMPDAF), is therefore developed to support the navigation and surveillance services of the ATM system. The conventional radar tracking algorithm, the nearest neighbor Kalman filter (NNKF), is used as the baseline to evaluate the proposed radar tracking algorithm, and the real flight data is used to validate the IMMPDAF algorithm. As shown in the results, the proposed IMMPDAF algorithm could enhance the tracking performance of the current aviation radar system and meets the required performance of the new ATM system. Thus, the current radar system with the IMMPDAF algorithm could be used as an alternative system to continue aviation navigation and surveillance services of the ATM system during GPS outage periods. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

To achieve this objective, the proposed approach employs wide area measured signals to estimate an accurate online model of power system dynamics using the dynamic mode decomposition with control (DMDc) method. The DMDc technique applies singular value decomposition (SVD) to the collected data matrices such that an accurate low-order approximation of system dynamics is obtained. The estimated model is thereafter utilized in designing the wide area damping controller (WADC) using discrete linear quadratic regulator (DLQR). Furthermore, kalman filtering is deployed to update the states of the designed controller and to remove the noise that is contained in the measured signals.

	abstract = {Because of the complexity of water environment, it is difficult to precisely model the fish robot system. Therefore, model-based attitude control algorithm is difficult to apply to the robotic fish. Cascade PID control uses the measurements of controlled variable and its derivative to constitute a double feedback loop. It can adjust the interference that influence the intermediate variable in advance and improve the dynamic quality and working frequency of the whole system. It is better than the traditional PID controller in anti-interference performance, rapidity, adaptation and stability. This article adopts the cascade PID algorithm to control the yaw angle of a robotic fish for the first time. This article innovatively uses a Kalman filter to eliminate the system angle error caused by periodic oscillation of robotic fish. A yaw angle control framework was proposed for biomimetic robotic fish. Based on the proposed framework, systematically yaw angle control experiments with the robotic fish were carried out in situations where the reference inputs were step signal, square wave and sine wave. Experiments showed that the robotic fish can accurately track the reference of the yaw angle in real time, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. © 2015 IEEE.},

In contrast to the traditional Prony and EKF methods for estimating the modes parameters, which require the order of the model and the initial parameters of the mode, the hybrid Prony-cross-correlation does not require any previous information.

	abstract = {Accurate battery modelling is the cornerstone to state of charge (SOC) and state of power (SOP) co-estimation of lithium-ion batteries in electric vehicles. Due to strong battery nonlinearity over a broad frequency range, traditional integer-order models are incapable of capturing complex battery dynamics for SOC and SOP co-estimation. This paper proposes a fractional-order modified moving horizon estimation (FO-mMHE) algorithm and a fractional-order model predictive control (FO-MPC) algorithm. Firstly, a second-order FOM is constructed by performing a series of hybrid pulse tests at different SOC regions, and its model parameters are identified through a particle swarm optimization-genetic algorithm method. Secondly, online SOC estimation is converted into a constrained optimization problem in a past moving horizon and then solved by the FO-mMHE algorithm, which enables fast convergence speed and proactive smoothing of estimation outcomes. Thirdly, the FO-MPC algorithm is devised to manipulate the current sequence in a prediction horizon for maximizing discharge/charge power accumulation and determining battery SOP in real time. Moreover, different battery current–voltage behaviors are comprehensively researched in the prediction horizon over a whole battery operating range. The proposed co-estimation method is validated under different dynamic load profiles. The experimental results demonstrate a SOC estimation error reduction of up to 1.2 % compared with the commonly used fractional-order extended Kalman filter while the SOP estimation error could be limited below 0.35 W. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Synchrophasor data provide unprecedented opportunities for inferring power system dynamics, such as estimating voltage angles, frequencies, and accelerations along with power injection at all buses. Aligned to this goal, this work puts forth a novel framework for learning dynamics after small-signal disturbances by leveraging Gaussian processes (GPs). We extend results on learning of a linear time-invariant system using GPs to the multi-input multi-output setup. This is accomplished by decomposing power system dynamics into a set of single-input single-output linear systems with narrow frequency pass bands. The proposed learning technique captures time derivatives in continuous time, accommodates data streams sampled at different rates, and can cope with missing data and heterogeneous levels of accuracy. While Kalman filter-based approaches require knowing all system inputs, the proposed framework handles readings of system inputs, outputs, their derivatives, and combinations thereof collected from an arbitrary subset of buses. Relying on minimal system information, it further provides uncertainty quantification in addition to point estimates of system dynamics. Numerical tests verify that this technique can infer dynamics at non-metered buses, impute and predict synchrophasors, and locate faults under linear and non-linear system models under ambient and fault disturbances.  © 1969-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Short-term load and price forecasting is an important issue in the optimal operation of restructured electric utilities. This paper presents a new intelligent hybrid three-stage model for simultaneous load and price forecasting. The proposed algorithm uses wavelet and Kalman machines for the first stage load and price forecasting. Each of the load and price data is decomposed into different frequency components, and Kalman machine is used to forecast each frequency components of load and price data. Then a Kohonen Self Organizing Map (SOM) finds similar days of load frequency components and feeds them into the second stage forecasting machine. In addition, mutual information based feature selection is used to find the relevant price data and rank them based on their relevance. The second stage uses Multi-Layer Perceptron Artificial Neural Network (MLP-ANN) and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) for forecasting of load and price frequency components, respectively. The third stage machine uses the second stage outputs and feeds them into its MLP-ANN and ANFIS machines to improve the load and price forecasting accuracy. The proposed three-stage algorithm is applied to Nordpool and mainland Spain power markets. The obtained results are compared with the recent load and price forecast algorithms, and showed that the three-stage algorithm presents a better performance for day-ahead electricity market load and price forecasting. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The combination of GPS measurements and high-fidelity dynamic models via a Kalman filter/smoother, known as the reduced dynamic technique, allows 3D positioning of Low Earth Orbiters to the sub-decimeter level. Such accuracies can only be achieved if the GPS data are nearly continuous, post-processed and a dual-frequency receiver is utilized. The focus of this study is to quantitatively analyze the degradations in position accuracy in the presence of various limitations or constraints, which can be brought on by mission hardware limitations, for example, on micro- or nanosatellites. The constraints explored in this study are as follows: the use of single-frequency data only; real-time processing; limited dynamic modeling due to computing capabilities; and non-continuous GPS receiver operation due to power limits. The experiments are conducted with 6-h data arcs for 7 separate days using data from the CHAllenging Mini-Satellite Payload. A 3D root mean square (rms) error of 15 cm is observed in the best-case solution, in which dual-frequency data are post-processed with all available data. Various levels of accuracy degradations are observed as constraints are placed on this best-case solution. The 3D rms error of the post-processed, single-frequency solution is 68 cm and 1.3 m for the real-time, dual-frequency solution. In very challenging environments, for example, with the receiver on for only 10 min of a 90-min orbit, the 3D rms increases to 350 m. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {Weak-signal and high-dynamics are of two primary concerns of space navigation using GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) in the space service volume (SSV). The paper firstly defines a reference assumption third-order phase-locked loop (PLL) as the baseline of an onboard GNSS receiver, and proves the incompetence of this conventional architecture. Then an adaptive four-state Kalman filter (KF)-based algorithm is introduced to realize the optimization of loop noise bandwidth, which can adaptively regulate its filter gain according to the received signal power and line-of-sight (LOS) dynamics. To overcome the matter of losing lock in weak-signal and high-dynamic environments, an open loop tracking strategy aided by an inertial navigation system (INS) is recommended, and the traditional maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method is modified in a non-coherent way by reconstructing the likelihood cost function. Furthermore, a typical mission with combined orbital maneuvering and non-maneuvering arcs is taken as a destination object to test the two proposed strategies. Finally, the experiment based on computer simulation identifies the effectiveness of an adaptive four-state KF-based strategy under non-maneuvering conditions and the virtue of INS-assisted methods under maneuvering conditions. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a Nonlinear Model Predictive Controller (NMPC) designed to provide optimal control input for maximum turbine power generation in an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) Waste Heat Recovery (WHR) system. While the literature is rich in ORC-WHR system modeling and control approaches in simulation environments, the fundamental dynamic analysis, system aging, thermal inertia, and experimental implementation of power optimization based optimal ORC-WHR control are still lacking. These factors are key to fully understanding and controlling the dynamic behavior of the system and are the main focus of this study. In contrast to prior literature, this work experimentally evaluates the nonlinear dynamics of the ORC system to comprehensively understand the controller design requirements. A power optimization-based Nonlinear Model Predictive Controller (NMPC) is derived utilizing an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) as a state estimator. Simulation results indicate that optimal turbine power generation is obtained with minimal working fluid superheat for the system under study. Consequently, a superheat-tracking controller is designed, and the performance of the controller is simulated over step inputs. The designed controller is then experimentally validated on an ORC test rig with a 13L Heavy Duty Diesel Engine (HDDE). During experimental evaluation of the controller, it was discovered that the control-oriented model is susceptible to system aging effects and therefore, the model was calibrated online to match the behavior of the aged system. Moreover, evaporator thermal inertia was found to play a vital role attenuating the fluctuating frequency components of the exhaust conditions. The tuned controller provided satisfactory control response for transient engine conditions and maintained the working fluid temperature within acceptable limits. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Recent empirical studies have shown thatmulticore scaling is fast becoming power limited, and consequently, an increasing fraction of a multicore processor has to be under clocked or powered off. Therefore, in addition to fundamental innovations in architecture, compilers and parallelization of application programs, there is a need to develop practical and effective dynamic energy management (DEM) techniques for multicore processors. ExistingDEMtechniques mainly target reducing processor power consumption and temperature, and only few of them have addressed improving energy efficiency for multicore systems.With energy efficiency taking a center stage in all aspects of computing, the focus of the DEM needs to be on finding practical methods to maximize processor efficiency. Towards this, this article presents STEAM - an optimal closed-loop DEM controller designed for multicore processors. The objective is to maximize energy efficiency by dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS). Energy efficiency is defined as the ratio of performance to power consumption or performance-per-watt (PPW). This is the same as the number of instructions executed per Joule. The PPW metric is actually replaced by PαPW (performanceα-per-Watt), which allows for controlling the importance of performance versus power consumption by varying α. The proposed controller was implemented on a Linux system and tested with the Intel Sandy Bridge processor. There are three power management schemes called governors, available with Intel platforms. They are referred to as (1) Powersave (lowest power consumption), (2) Performance (achieves highest performance), and (3) Ondemand. Our simple and lightweight controller when executing SPEC CPU2006, PARSEC, and MiBench benchmarks have achieved an average of 18% improvement in energy efficiency (MIPS/Watt) over these ACPI policies. Moreover, STEAM also demonstrated an excellent prediction of core temperatures and power consumption, and the ability to control the core temperatures wihin 3°C of the specified maximum. Finally, the overhead of the STEAM implementation (in terms of CPU resources) is less than 0.25%. The entire implementation is self-contained and can be installed on any processor with very little prior knowledge of the processor. © 2014 Copyright held by the Owner/Author.

The control method is used a modified Direct Torque Control scheme with constant inverter switching frequency using Space Vector Modulation (SVPWM). The variation of stator resistance due to changes in temperature or frequency deteriorates the performance of DTC-SVM controller by introducing errors in the estimated flux linkage and the electromagnetic torque. As a result, this approach will not be suitable for high power drives such as those used in tractions, as they require good torque control performance at considerably lower frequency. A novel stator resistance estimator is proposed. The estimation method is implemented using the Extended Kalman Filter. Finally, extensive simulation results are presented to validate the proposed technique.

	abstract = {Power system stabilizers (PSSs) are traditionally used to provide damping torque for the synchronous generators to suppress the oscillations by generating supplementary control signals for the generator excitation system. Numerous techniques have previously been proposed to design PSSs but many of them are synthesized based on a linearized model. The dynamic characteristics of the proposed PSS are studied in a typical synchronous machine connected to infinite-bus of power system through transmission line. This paper deals with the applying of the Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) technique to the design of the robust controller for two models of power system. The first model represents only the electrical control part of power system by means synchronous generator connected to infinite bus, while the second model, adding a turbine and governor to the model 1. Combined the Kalman filter, which is an optimal observer with the optimal LQR regulator to construct the optimal LQG controller are evaluated. Electromechanical oscillations of small magnitude and low frequency exist in the power system operation and often persist for long periods of time. Simulation results show the proposed PSS is robust for such nonlinear dynamic system and achieves better performance than the conventional PSS in damping oscillations. © 2015 World Scientific and Engineering Academy and Society.

	abstract = {To estimate time-varying MIMO channel at base station, traditional downlink (DL) channel restoration schemes usually require the reconstruction for the covariance of downlink process noise vector, which is dependent on DL channel covariance matrix (CCM). However, the acquisition of the CCM leads to extremely high overhead in massive MIMO systems. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel scheme for DL channel tracking in this paper. First, by utilizing virtual channel representation (VCR), we develop a dynamic uplink (UL) massive MIMO channel model with the consideration of off-grid refinement. Then, a coordinate-wise expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is adopted for capturing model parameters, including the spatial signatures, time-correlation factors, off-grid bias, channel power, and noise power. By exploiting the UL/DL angle reciprocity, the spatial signatures, time-correlation factors and off-grid bias of the DL channel model can be reconstructed with the knowledge of UL. However, channel power and noise power are closely related with the carrier frequency, which cannot be perfectly inferred from the UL. Instead of discovering these two parameters with dedicated training, we resort to the optimal Bayesian Kalman filter (OBKF) method to accurately track the DL channel with partial prior knowledge. At the same time, the model parameters will be gradually restored. Specially, the factor-graph and the Metropolis Hastings MCMC are utilized within the OBKF framework. Finally, numerical results are provided to demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed scheme. © 1972-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The accuracy and stability of the receiver clock is particularly important to improve the performance of satellite navigation and positioning. High-precision atomic clocks can help reduce the minimum number of visible satellites required for GNSS positioning and automatic integrity monitoring. Especially for the Radio Determination Satellite Service (RDSS) system, it is difficult to meet the requirements of some high-dynamic applications for the reason it works with active round trip ranging. If the atomic clock in the receiver can maintain high precision in a long time, it can help RDSS system to realize the real-time positioning in passive way for dynamic applications. Most receiver clock error is big enough compared with the other ranging error sources. It always changes quickly and is not easy to predict for its random characters during its power on period, even Rubidium Atomic Clock. In this paper, time and frequency error of the rubidium atomic clock of the user receiver are analyzed by using the GNSS satellite ranging measurement. A linear exponential model suitable for Rubidium Atomic receiver clock error was put forward according to the actual data analysis. In order to have a more accurate clock error prediction, a Kalman filter method based on parameter constrains was proposed for modelling the clock error in the beginning of receiver power on and clock error prediction in later time. Experiments were done on one satellite receiver with Rubidium Atomic Clock using BD1 RDSS satellite signal. The results show that this method can greatly improve the prediction accuracy of Rubidium Atomic Clock error. © 2017 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The main purpose of this paper is to enhance the operation of renewable wind energy conversion (WEC) systems connected to power systems. To achieve this, we consider a linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control approach for regulating the effects of a WEC system with doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) on the synchronous generator (SG) rotor speed of the interconnected power system. First, we present the mathematical formulation of the interconnected power system comprises a single synchronous generator and a wind turbine with DFIG connected to an infinite bus bar system through a transmission line. We consider that the system is operated under various loading conditions and parameters variation. Second, a frequency damping oscillation observer is designed via Kalman filtering together with an optimal linear quadratic regulator to mitigate the impacts of the WEC system on the SG rotor speed. The performance of the developed interconnected power system is simulated using a MATLAB/SIMULINK environment to verify the effectiveness of the developed controller. In comparison with previously reported results, the proposed approach can stabilize the interconnected power system within 1.28 s compared to 1.3 s without the DFIG. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {In this paper a sensorless control strategy has been implemented and experimentally validated to control independently the electromagnetic torque and the reactive power of a doubly-fed induction machine. The machine acts as a grid connected generator at variable speed operations around the synchronous speed. This control strategy is based on a model-predictive control strategy with the governing equations represented in a synchronous reference frame aligned to the stator flux. A modulation stage has been introduced in order to overcome the well-known issues of the model-predictive control strategies, such as high current ripple and the non-constant switching frequency. The stator flux vector has been identified by using a programmable low-pass filter achieving an acceptable estimate which is not affected by the integer offset derived problems, and it does not require high number of calculations as by using a full-order observer. The rotor position feedback signal needed to implement the control strategy has been estimated by using an extended Kalman filter. The machine under test is a 7.5kW doubly-fed induction machine. Simulations are carried out by using the software Matlab/Simulink 2018b showing how the electromagnetic torque and the reactive power of the machine can be successfully controlled without the need of the encoder signal; furthermore low current ripple and high dynamic response can be achieved making the studied control strategy suitable for grid-connected variable speed operation such as wind energy conversion systems. © 2019 EPE Association.},

	abstract = {Interconnected power grid exhibits oscillatory response after a disturbance in the system. One such type of oscillation, the inter-area oscillation has the oscillation frequency in the range of 0.1-1 Hz. The damping of inter-area oscillations is difficult with local controllers, but it can be achieved using a wide area damping controller (WADC). For effective control, the input to the WADC should be the most observable signal, and the WADC output should be sent to the most controllable generator. This study presents a measurement-based novel algorithm for multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) transfer function identification of the power system to estimate such oscillation frequencies. The wide-area control loop is estimated using the MIMO transfer function, and the WADC design is a combination of the discrete linear quadratic regulator and Kalman filtering for the damping of inter-area oscillations. Since the MIMO identification is performed using the actual measurements, the proposed method can accurately monitor changes in the power grid, whereas the conventional methods are derived from small-signal analysis of a linearized model that does not consider changing operating conditions. The overall algorithm is implemented and validated on a RTDS/RSCAD® and MATLAB® real-time co-simulation platform using two-area and IEEE 39-bus power system models. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2020.},

In this paper, operation of a recently proposed battery-supercapacitor hybrid energy storage system (HESS) comprising two DC/AC boost converters, battery, supercapacitors, grid connection, state of charge (SOC) estimation, and associated control systems is experimentally verified and further improved. The improvement is achieved by a phase-shifted interleaved operation of the boost converters. The proposed phase-shifted interleaved operation reduces the switching frequency current ripple component in both the battery and supercapacitor currents. Experimental results show that during the interleaved operation, the HESS operates as expected and allocates all fast current variations to the supercapacitor, while the battery responds to slow varying current demands. At the same time, the control system maintains the supercapacitor voltage at around a predefined value and the battery's SOC, estimated using an extended Kalman filter, is maintained within the specified SOC limits. © 1986-2012 IEEE.},

In these applications low size, weight and power are vital design constraints. This paper proposes methods for improving the geolocation estimate available to a system in indoor and urban environments without the need for addition sensing or transmitting hardware. This paper proposes novel system application techniques that enable the integration of signals of opportunity, providing a robust geolocation estimate without any additional hardware. The proposed method utilises a sinusoidal Kalman filter architecture to analyse raw radio frequency (RF) signals that surround a system in urban and indoor environments. The introduced techniques efficiently analyse the raw RF data from any signal of opportunity and combine it with higher level geolocation sensors to provide an improved geolocation estimate. The improvements achieved by the system in a range of environments have been simulated, analysed and compared to the results obtained using the prior art. These improvements have been further validated and benchmarked by hardware test. The results obtained provide evidence that the efficient use of signals of opportunity coupled with common navigation sensors can provide a robust and reliable geolocation system in indoor and urban environments. © 2017, Institut Mines-Télécom and Springer-Verlag France.},

	abstract = {The tractor load is a continuous and dynamic random load with time-varying amplitude and frequency, the time domain characteristics of which are represented by steady-state value, instantaneous value and dynamic load variation coefficient. The time domain characteristics of the random load reflect tractor working state, which are important parameters of tractor control systems for ploughing depth, selection of operating gears and timing of shifting, and load distribution of hybrid power. This kind of dynamic load signal is a colored random signal mixed in other random noises, and its time domain characteristics are difficult to obtain online, which becomes the bottleneck influencing the random load characteristics applied to the field of tractor real-time control. In this paper, based on the study of time domain and frequency domain characteristics of tractor random load signal, the triggered quadratic frequency conversion adaptive Kalman filter algorithm is used to realize the real-time extraction of random load characteristics. Then white noise is eliminated by Kalman filter to extract colored random load signals, and the load steady-state value is obtained after the colored noise is whitened by reducing sampling frequency of secondary filtering. In view of the unknown statistical characteristics of secondary filtering noise, a triggered fading adaptive filter combined with vehicle bus network information sharing technology is adopted to ensure the ability of filter to quickly track the load change. The simulation results show that the random load signal obtained by the algorithm is close to the reference value, and the load variation coefficient can reflect the characteristic changes of the random load, which lays a foundation for the dynamic control of tractor operation process. © 2019 IEEE.},

The experimental work has been carried out on a typical three-phase alternating current arc furnace installation. In the recommended method, the reference frame is rotated in both directions at speeds corresponding to the positive and negative sequences of all harmonics and all interharmonics 5 Hz apart. To extract the direct current components of the transformed d-q quantities, a low-pass filter is employed. In order to keep the delay of the filter at zero frequency less than a few ms, Kalman estimation technique has been used. Back transformation is then applied for each harmonic and interharmonic component to obtain their positive-and negative-sequences of the associated harmonic and interharmonic in the actual line current waveforms. Parallel computing technique has been applied for the real-time detection of both the phase and the amplitude of all harmonics and interharmonics. This is achieved on NVDIA Jetson TX1 graphics processing unit framework for a sample industrial plant.

	abstract = {In the context of smart grids, residential air conditioners, as the major contributors to home electricity bills and loads on electrical grids, need to be not only energy-efficient, but also grid-responsive to relieve power supply-demand imbalance. Existing demand response control strategies for residential air conditioners focus on single-speed type and mainly adopt temperature set point reset to respond to hourly day-ahead electricity prices. This study represents the first attempt to directly control the operating frequency of inverter air conditioners in response to high-granularity electricity price signals, i.e., 5-minute real-time electricity prices, using model predictive control method. A simplified room thermal model in the stochastic state-space representation and performance maps of an inverter air conditioner are developed and integrated for predicting the coupled thermal response of an air-conditioned room. A demand response-enabled model predictive controller is designed based on the coupled model to optimally control the operating frequency of the inverter air conditioner while taking account of all the influential variables including weather conditions, occupancy, and 5-min real-time electricity prices. A Kalman filter is adopted to estimate the unmeasurable variables and remove the noises in measurements. A TRNSYS-MATLAB co-simulation testbed is developed to test the thermal and energy performances of the model predictive controller. Results show that compared to the PID controller, the demand response-enabled model predictive controller can implement automatic and optimal precooling to improve occupant's thermal comfort at the beginning of occupancy. Moreover, it can also reduce average power consumption during peak demand periods by 17.31% to 38.86% compared with the PID controller and reduce all-day electricity costs by 0.42% to 22.16%. The frequency-based model predictive control method enables residential inverter air conditioners to be more grid-friendly and cost-efficient. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This paper presents a variable structure control in natural frame for a three-phase gird-connected voltage-source inverter with LCL filter. The proposed control method is based on modifying the converter model in natural reference frame, preserving the low-frequency state-space variables dynamics. Using this model in a Kalman filter (KF), the system state-space variables are estimated allowing us to design three independent current sliding-mode controllers. The main closed-loop features of the proposed method are: first, robustness against grid inductance variations because the proposed model is independent of the grid inductance; second, the power losses are reduced since physical damping resistors are avoided; third, the control bandwidth can be increased due to the combination of a variable hysteresis comparator with the KF; and fourth, the grid-side current is directly controlled providing high robustness against harmonics in the grid. To complete the control scheme, a theoretical stability analysis is developed. Finally, selected experimental results validate the proposed control strategy and permit illustrating all its appealing features. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an iterative decimation approach to significantly alleviate the computational burden of centralized controllers applying real-time recursive system identification algorithms in multi-rail power converters. The proposed approach uses an adaptive update rate as opposed to the fixed update rate used in conventional adaptive filters. Also, the step size/forgetting factors vary at different iteration stages. As a result, a reduced computational burden and faster model update can be achieved. Besides, recursive algorithms, such as Recursive Least Square (RLS), Fast Affine Projection (FAP) and Kalman Filter (KF), contain two important updates per iteration cycle; Covariance Matrix Approximation (CMA) update and Gradient Vector (GV) update. Usually, the CMA update requires the greater computational effort than the GV update. Therefore, in circumstances where the sampled data in the regressor does not experience significant fluctuations, re-using the CMA, calculated from the last iteration cycle for the current update can result in computational cost savings for real-time system identification. In this paper, both iteration rate adjustment and CMA re-cycling are combined and applied to simultaneously identify the power converter models in a three-rail power conversion architecture.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new voltage estimation method for the submodule (SM) capacitor in a modular multilevel converter (MMC). The proposed method employs a Kalman filter algorithm to estimate the SM voltages of the converter. Compared with sensor-based methods, this scheme requires only one voltage sensor to achieve the voltage-balancing of the converter. This sensor is connected to the total arm voltage; the proposed algorithm also requires the switching patterns of each upper SM switch, which are provided by the controller used without the need for extra sensors. The substantial reduction in the number of voltage sensors improves the system reliability and decreases its cost and complexity. Extensive simulation and experimental analyses carried out to validate the proposed estimation scheme under different conditions include steady-state analyses, the effect of variations in capacitance and inductance, the impact of low carrier and effective switching frequency on the accuracy of the estimation, step changes to the load, and range changes in dc voltage.

	abstract = {The use of massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology has enabled increased efficiency and capacity of wireless communication systems. When the downlink channel to user terminals (UTs) is known at the base station (BS), the BS can precode transmission to simplify detection at the UTs. In frequency division duplexed (FDD) systems, obtaining CSI at the transmitter to fully exploit the advantages of massive MIMO is complicated, since the number of channel coefficients to be trained and fed back from the UT is very large. This is exacerbated in the case where the channel is time varying, where frequent retraining and feedback is required. However, if the channel coefficients are spatially correlated, the amount of feedback required can be reduced significantly. In this paper, we consider the case where the channel coefficients from the BS to the UTs are spatially correlated, and show that efficient allocation of training power based on eigenvalues of the channel correlation matrix significantly boosts achievable rates. Further, we show that using Kalman filters to track the evolving channel coefficients reduces the need to retrain channels, and the reduced training requirement translates to higher data rates. Simulations confirm that optimal training and tracking channel modes enhances rates significantly. © 1972-2012 IEEE.},

Combined the Kalman filter, which is an optimal observer with the optimal LQR regulator to construct the optimal LQG controller are evaluated. Electromechanical oscillations of small magnitude and low frequency exist in the power system operation and often persist for long periods of time. Power system stabilizers (PSSs) are traditionally used to provide damping torque for the synchronous generators to suppress the oscillations by generating supplementary control signals for the generator excitation system. Numerous techniques have previously been proposed to design PSSs but many of them are synthesized based on a linearized model. The dynamic characteristics of the proposed PSS are studied in a typical synchronous machine connected to infinite-bus of power system through transmission line. Simulation results show the proposed PSS is robust for such nonlinear dynamic system and achieves better performance than the conventional PSS in damping oscillations.},

The experimental work has been carried out on a typical three-phase alternating current arc furnace (AC EAF) installation. In the recommended method, the reference frame is rotated in both directions at speeds corresponding to the positive and negative sequences of all harmonics and all interharmonics 5-Hz apart. To extract the direct current (DC) components of the transformed d-q quantities, a low-pass filter is employed. In order to keep the delay of the filter at zero frequency less than a few ms, Kalman estimation technique has been used. Back transformation is then applied for each harmonic and interharmonic component to obtain their positive-and negative-sequences of the associated harmonic and interharmonic in the actual line current waveforms. Parallel computing technique has been applied for the real-Time detection of both the phase and the amplitude of all harmonics and interharmonics. This is achieved on NVDIA Jetson TX1 graphics processing unit (GPU) framework for a sample industrial plant. The developed system is shown to be useful for fast and accurate generation of reference signals for the controllers of the advanced technology power conditioning systems which successfully compensates interharmonics, harmonics, and flicker of the rapidly fluctuating nonlinear industrial loads. © 2017 IEEE.},

The problems which were introduced about the traditional power grid, and also, the growing advances in smart technologies make the traditional power grid go towards smart power grid. Although widespread utilisation of telecommunication networks in smart power grid enhances the efficiency of the system, it will create a critical platform for cyber attacks and penetration into the system. Automatic generation control (AGC) is a fundamental control system in the power grid, and it is responsible for controlling the frequency of the grid. An attack on the data transmitted through the telecommunications link from the sensors to the AGC will cause frequency deviation, resulting in disconnection of the load, generators and ultimately global blackout. In this study, by using a Kalman filter and a proposed detector, a solution has been presented to detect the attack before it can affect the system. Contrary to existing methods, this method is able to detect attacks that are stealthy from the area control error signal and X2-detector.

The difference between the two modifications of the embedded controllers lies in the different types of output signals, which are used as feedback in control system. The comparative analysis of time and frequency domain properties of controllers are performed. The results obtained show the better performance of one system. The control algorithms are implemented in 32-bit microcontroller. A number of experiments have been executed, which confirm the quality of the electrohydraulic power steering control system.  © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Dynamic state estimation of synchronous generators is associated with various state space model based monitoring and control strategies. Estimation algorithms based on Kalman Filter are mainly used for estimation of the states locally using the generator input and output measurements. Whereas, wide area power system monitoring and control strategies require remote estimation of states and relies on Phasor Measurement Unit's (PMU) measurement signals which are limited to the generator output measurements like voltage, current, and frequency. In case of basic Kalman Filter based techniques, apart from output measurements, input measurements are also required for the estimation of states. This paper proposes an improved extended Unbiased Minimum Variance Filter algorithm that utilises Unscented Transform for remote state estimation with limited PMU measurements. The estimation is performed in the absence of input measurements. The performance of the filter under variation in input, measurement errors and the effect of initial estimate are analysed. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper treats pilot aided multi-path channel estimation with tracking loops for OFDM systems under slow to moderate fading conditions. Recent works have presented theoretical results for the tuning of second-order and third-order tracking loops in the particular context of Jakes's Doppler spectrum channel. The method for getting the loop coefficients resorted either to the use of a given constraint, which made the obtained coefficients sub-optimal, or was obtained in part by simulations. Here, we perform a global optimization of the coefficients without constraints to get the optimal coefficients, and analytical formulas are provided. One remarkable result of this optimization is that only the natural frequency depends on the transmission parameters, i.e., the channel Doppler spectrum, the power delay profile, and the noise variance. Consequently, only one parameter has to be tuned. Moreover, asymptotic performance is formulated in a more general way as a function of the 2rth moments of the Doppler spectrum (r is the loop order). Hence, all our derivations are usable for any Doppler spectrum and are not specific to Jakes's Doppler spectrum. A complete table sums up for the three orders of the theoretical results of the optimal coefficients together with the asymptotic performance. The performance is also compared with that of the asymptotic Kalman filter. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a novel islanding fault detection method for distributed generation systems. Islanding fault detection of distributed generation systems in microgrids and smart grids is an essential security technology. The existing methods for islanding fault detection can be classified as passive methods (such as under/over voltage detection, under/over frequency detection, and voltage phase jump detection, based on natural effects of islanding) and active methods (impedance measurement, slip mode frequency shift, Sandia frequency shift and so on). Once the power consumed by a local load matches the power generated by a local inverter, the islanding phenomenon will be not obvious, and traditional passive methods may fail. In contrast, the active methods can overcome this disadvantage. However, active methods create extra disturbances that may degrade the quality of power generated by the inverter. By reducing the harmonics of the inverter output, coupled with the use of a novel filtering method, the proposed approach can be achieved without additional disturbance and does no nondetection zone islanding detection. In this paper, current harmonic compensation is applied to inverter control to minimize the inverter output harmonics, highlighting on the grid harmonics. Set-membership filter is developed to estimate the voltage harmonics. Islanding condition is detected by the changes of the specific order harmonics. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by simulations. A Kalman filter contrast experiment is presented to confirm that the set-membership filter can more effectively detect islanding. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

This paper presents a novel fixed-gain filter (FGF) scheme with an optimal fixed feedback gain matrix to estimate the (angle) position and frequency of the grid, which ensures a fast and accurate synchronization under varying grid conditions. Instead of using the conventional phase-locked loop (PLL) scheme that suffers from the difficulty of parameter selection, the concept of the Kalman filter (KF) is synthesized to design the second-order FGF and third-order FGF for synchronization. To overcome the heavy computational processing for the KF, the feedback gain is subject to a single tunable parameter only, which can be calculated offline and refined within a certain small range fulfilling the system stability criterion. Compared with the PLL approach, the new FGF provides a faster and more precise tracking performance, an easier parameter tuning mechanism, a lower program complexity, and a better grid stability, which is verified by simulations and experiments in all cases. © 1982-2012 IEEE.},

In order to accurately and effectively express the thermal load of a proportional solenoid valve under random load conditions and to meet the requirements of online acquisition, adaptive anomaly detection, and the missing substitution of thermal load data, a thermal load prediction model based on the Kalman filter algorithm is proposed. Taking the compound operation process of an excavator as the object and based on the field testing of an excavator and the independent testing experiment of a proportional solenoid valve in a non-installed state, a method of obtaining historical samples of the proportional solenoid valve’s power and thermal load is given. The k-means clustering algorithm is used to cluster the historical samples of the power and thermal load corresponding to the working posture of a multi-tool excavator. The Grubbs criterion is used to eliminate the outliers in the clustering samples, and unbiased estimation is performed on the clustering samples to obtain the prediction model. The results show that the cross-validation of the sample data under the specific sample characteristics of the thermal load model was carried out. Compared with other methods, the prediction accuracy of the thermal load model based on the Kalman filter is higher, the adaptability is strong, and the maximum prediction deviation percentage is stable within 5%.

Such training targets fall into four categories: Line spectrum frequency (LSF), LPC power spectrum (LPC-PS), power spectrum (PS), and magnitude spectrum (MS) training targets. The choice of training target can have a significant impact on LPC estimation accuracy. Motivated by this, we perform a comprehensive study of the training targets with the aim of determining which is best for LPC estimation. To this end, we evaluate each training target using a temporal convolutional network (TCN) and a multi-head attention-based network. A large training set constructed from a wide variety of conditions, including real-world non-stationary and coloured noise sources over a range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels, is used for training. Testing on the NOIZEUS corpus demonstrates that the LPC-PS as the training target produces the lowest clean speech LPC spectral distortion (SD) level. We also construct the augmented Kalman filter (AKF) with the estimated speech and noise LPC parameters of each training target. Subjective AB listening tests and seven objective quality and intelligibility evaluation measures (CSIG, CBAK, COVL, PESQ, STOI, SegSNR, and SI-SDR) revealed that the LPC-PS training target produced enhanced speech at the highest quality and intelligibility amongst the training targets. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a model-based maximum power point tracking (MPPT) technique is presented for a two-stage grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) system, where the loci of the maximum power points (MPPs) is specified accurately based on a new formulation. In this formulation, the effect of both irradiance and temperature is taken into consideration, whereas the irradiance is estimated to reduce the cost of the system and enhance its reliability. Furthermore, constant power generation (CPG) is integrated with the developed MPPT method to facilitate other power regulation schemes in the PV system. The proposed methodology is compared with the well-known perturb and observe (P&O) method for evaluation. Additionally, a modified version of the P&O is included in the comparison for better assessment. The effect of different partial shading conditions on the system's performance is also investigated. The DC-link PI controller is replaced with a new adaptive DC-link controller to enhance the transient behavior of the PV system. Moreover, the suggested DC-link controller removes the DC offsets, which appear in case of gradient increase or decrease in the input PV power. In contrast to the conventional PI controller, which has poor performance at such circumstances. The active and reactive power exchange with the grid is managed using a computationally efficient finite-set model predictive control (FS-MPC) algorithm. Furthermore, switching frequency minimization is added as a secondary objective using a weighting factorless procedure. The grid-voltage sensors are eliminated and estimated using an extended Kalman filter (EKF). The overall control strategy is evaluated using experimental implementation, hardware-in-the-loop (HIL), and matlab/simulink.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The control problem in wave energy continues to remain an open question. This is mainly attributed to the difficulties associated with developing effective, yet economically viable, wave energy-harnessing control strategies, such as resource irregularity, the multidisciplinary nature of the system, and dynamic model uncertainties and ambiguities. Herein, a maximum energy-capturing approach for heaving wave energy converters (WECs) using an estimator-based finite control set model predictive control (FCS-MPC) is proposed. The proposed control strategy utilizes an elaborate nonlinear wave-to-wire model of a heaving WEC. The FCS-MPC is formulated such that a control command trajectory is not required; instead, it searches for the optimum control law - in the form of switching functions - that maximizes the WEC converted electrical energy while imposing soft constraints on the states of the power take-off (PTO) mechanism. Current transducers are deployed to measure the PTO three-phase currents and both mechanical and electrical variables required by the FCS-MPC strategy are estimated using an electrical-based extended Kalman filter (E-EKF). Simulations were performed to assess the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy. Results presented herein clearly show that the proposed referenceless FCS-MPC managed to produce 10%-23% more energy compared with benchmark resistive loading-based techniques with both fixed and variable wave frequency capabilities while utilizing 18%-45% less PTO resources. © 2013 IEEE.},

The proposed Digital PLL is base on the loop filter that is observer-controlled, which helps to filter out entire additive noise and the output is improved in the terms of phase noise and transient time response. The main drawback of the previous PLLs is current transreceiver noise that modifies the overall phase noise output of the system is overcome by the new technique known as oscillator pulling technique. Here the output can be separate out without modifying the general performance of phase noise. The observer filter is fundamentally a second-order time-varying system having fundamental gain value. The proposed Digital PLL has been simulated using 0.35 μm CMOS technology. The proposed DPLL is having lesser phase jitter, high operating frequency, and less complexity of the circuit.

	abstract = {Most existing navigation solutions for single and multi-agent gun-launched systems rely heavily on Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements. Navigation solutions for high-dynamic multi-agent aerial systems in GPS contested environments often require either expensive components, such as navigation-grade inertial measurement units (IMU), fragile and range-limited lidar, or computationally expensive image processing techniques for simultaneous localization and mapping. The sensing and computational capabilities for low-cost, low-power, gun-launched projectiles are particularly limited. In this paper we propose an unanchored localization solution for autonomous navigation of gun-launched projectiles in GPS contested environments. It is shown that radio-frequency (RF) ranging, augmented with stochastic Kalman filtering, can be processed via multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) for robust unanchored localization. The results from a simulated trajectory are shown to demonstrate algorithm effectiveness in a representative scenario, and various navigation performance metrics are discussed. Extension of this work to the anchored localization of multi-agent systems will also be discussed. © 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA. All rights reserved.},

This paper proposes an observer-based model predictive control approach to meet these control objectives for single and three-phase grid inverters with LCL filters. A Kalman-filter based observer design is used to estimate the system states and harmonic disturbances based on the grid current measurement. A model predictive control scheme is employed to achieve offset-free reference tracking for the grid current, and rejection of low frequency harmonics. The scheme features not only rejection of grid voltage harmonics, but also rejection of low frequency inverter distortion caused, for example, by nonlinear filter inductances. The effectiveness of the scheme is demonstrated in simulation. © 2013 IEEE.},

In this paper, we envision a virtual trackpad interface that tracks user input on any surface near the mobile device. We adopt acoustic signal as the only medium used for the interaction, which can be handled by lightweight signal processing using inexpensive sensors on mobile devices. In our vTrack prototype, the peripheral device simply emits inaudible acoustic signals through a loudspeaker, while the receiving device performs sound source localization by leveraging a multi-channel microphone array. We build a fingerprint-based localization model using various cues, such as time difference of arrival, angle of arrival, and power spectrum density of the audio signal. The vTrack system integrates the frequency difference of arrival incurred by the Doppler shift to track the sound source in motion. Finally, the position estimations are fed into the extended Kalman filter to reduce errors and smooth the output. We implement our system on Android devices and validate its feasibility. Our extensive experiments show that vTrack achieves millimeter-level accuracy in the moving sound source scenario. Copyright © 2016 EAI},

	abstract = {The introduction of Micro-Electro-Mechanical-System based IMU (MIMU) is a bold and meaningful conception for small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) autonomous approaching and landing. The adoption of a low-cost MIMU with high noise, which is suitable for UAV applications with advantages in cost-effectiveness, lightweight, miniature design, low power consumption, and survivability. However, complicated flight dynamics and MIMU noise pose a great challenge for precise navigation of UAV autonomous landing. In this paper, a precise GNSS/MIMU integrated navigation scheme is derived to achieve autonomous landing, based on STIM-300 MIMU and BeiDou/GPS multi-frequency multi-mode precise relative positioning. The precise MIMU error model is established based on Allan variance analysis to resist the influence of noise uncertainty of MIMU. A real-time improvement is introduced in the conventional data fusion algorithm considering the delayed observations and time synchronization. Moreover, a novel in-flight coarse alignment of MIMU is adopted to guarantee accurate and reliable fine alignment afterward. The land vehicle test results indicate the proposed algorithm can complete accurate and reliable navigation (CatIIIc precision requirements) even in GNSS outages (≤12 s). As a cost-effective scheme, it has significant application potential for small UAV autonomous approaching and landing in highly poor weather conditions such as heavy fog and snow. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2016.},

	abstract = {Estimating the values of internal states representing the synchronous generators is very much essential in various monitoring and control strategies based on the state-space model. Kalman filter-based techniques are used to estimate the states locally using the input and output measurements of the generator so that the expectation of error is minimum. Wide area power system (WAPS) control requires remote monitoring of these states. Phasor measurement units (PMU) are widely used for remote monitoring and control in WAPS, but the remote measurements are limited to output measurements like voltage, current, and frequency. In the case of Kalman filter-based techniques in addition to the output measurements, input measurements like field and torque input are also required in order to estimate the states. This paper proposes an input invariant filter technique for remote estimation of generator states using the limited PMU measurements, even in the absence of mechanical input torque and field voltage measurements. The performance of the filter under various grid conditions and change in input signals are analyzed in this paper. The effect of measurement error, PMU refresh rate, and execution time are also analyzed. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Modern power systems are extensively interlaced with data communication at various levels leading to increased vulnerability to cyberattacks at individual components as well as integrated controls. An effective cyber protection is, therefore, fast becoming an indispensable requirement for the smart grids. A false data injection (FDI) attack on load frequency control (LFC) is a stealth process, which has devastating consequences while at times may also lead to catastrophic system blackouts. This work comprises detailed analyses of the LFC system vulnerability to FDI attacks. It further develops an efficient event-triggered detection scheme to leverage the LFC protection against FDI attacks. This developed event-triggered generalised extended state observer (ET-GESO) uses Lyapunov stability analysis to derive the event-triggering condition and thereby reduce the communication burden significantly. The feasibility of the proposed ET-GESO is further studied by demonstrating its Zeno behaviour exclusion. Extensive simulation studies are performed on a peer-reported two-area power transacting system and IEEE 39-bus New England system. A comparison study between the proposed technique and reported Kalman filter-based detection scheme is also performed. Different FDI attack formulations and their detection illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed detection method. © 2020 Institution of Engineering and Technology. All rights reserved.},

The proposed filtering system allows an automatic selection of the adequate filter by applying the support vector machine (SVM). The SVM classification is based on an electrocardiogram feature vector that integrates four main input characteristics (maximum and minimum amplitudes, maximum frequency and power spectral density). This paper provides ECG denoising efficiency based on the automatic selection of three different competing filtering methods: the discrete wavelet transform (DWT), empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and the extended Kalman filter (EKF). The extensive simulations are performed by using the MIT-BIH database. The effectiveness of the proposed system is evaluated in term of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improvement in decibel (dB). The results showed that the proposed automatic ECG filtering system provided a better signal-to-noise ratio compared to the DWT, EMD or EKF algorithm alone.

	abstract = {Alternative navigation is an area of research that employs a variety of sensor technologies to provide a navigation solution in Global Navigation Satellite System degraded or denied environments. The Autonomy and Navigation Technology Center at the Air Force Institute of Technology has recently developed the Autonomous and Resilient Management of All-source Sensors (ARMAS) navigation framework, which utilizes a bank of Kalman filters to provide a navigation solution resilient to sensor failures. The Kalman filter bank size increases exponentially as the number of system sensors and detectable faults are scaled up linearly, which in turn creates a stressful computational power requirement in a real-world large-scale ARMAS application. In an effort to engineer an operational real-time ARMAS system, this study presents a novel approach that utilizes multiple ARMAS subsystems cooperating as a single navigation system to generate a navigation solution with less computational demand. The new software design model allows batches of faulty sensors to be excluded from the final navigation solution under a multiple simultaneous sensor fault situation without the computational stress of identifying every individual faulty sensor. By segregating system sensors into unique groups that are susceptible to a failing under the same circumstances (i.e. satellites operating in the same frequency under a jamming scenario), an ARMAS subsystem can detect the first sensor failure in a group triggering the navigation system to remove the entire sensor group from the navigation solution while continuing recovery efforts within the ARMAS subsystem. Simulations results show that maintaining 37 simultaneous Kalman filters provided equivalent performance to the 2,533,987 simultaneous filters that would be required under the original formulation of ARMAS. © 2021 Proceedings of the 34th International Technical Meeting of the Satellite Division of the Institute of Navigation, ION GNSS+ 2021.

RSSI is the backbone of most widely used localization algorithms and thus such fluctuations will have a negative impact on the location estimation accuracy. This paper proposes an accurate solution for indoor localization for medical applications. This work shows how to overcome RSSI instability due to equipment and environment, and to calculate the distances of a target from readers. Then the distances are used to get the coordinates of the target by means of improved trilateration algorithm. The proposed localization is based on the following: scanning only one BLE advertising channel, introducing a hard fluctuations removal filter, a weighted Kalman filter before distances calculation, and a weighted trilateration for position calculation. Test results confirm that the proposed system has an error of less than 0.5m for 95% of readings in line of sight testing. Also, the system is scalable and optimized in terms of cost and power consumption. © 2019 IEEE.},

These methods eliminate singular items in the sound pressure signal, filter noise, smooth burrs, and so on. In addition, the sound intensity value is calculated by dual hydrophone method. In this paper, the average intensity of ultrasonic cavitation is studied. The radial distribution and longitudinal distribution of cavitation intensity of the same tool head are studied, and the effects of different power and different tool heads on cavitation intensity are also discussed in this paper. The experimental results show that the instrument designed in this paper can effectively measure the distribution of ultrasonic sound field and evaluate the performance of the tool head.

	abstract = {Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) are the main part of the integrated navigation for most of the aerial vehicles. However, the accuracy of an inertial navigation solution decreases with time as the inertial instrument (e.g., gyroscope and accelerometer) errors are integrated through the navigation equations. Therefore, different aiding techniques are used to limit the drift in these systems. One of the commonly used techniques is the integration of INS with Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals. By means of this integration, the advantages of both technologies are combined to give a complete and accurate navigation solution. However, GNSS signals travelled from the satellites to the receiver are at a very low power level. This low power level makes the signals susceptible to interference from other unintentional or intentional signals transmitted in the GNSS frequency range. If the interfering signal is sufficiently powerful, it becomes impossible for the receiver to detect the low power GNSS signal. There are different types of interference signals like jamming and spoofing. GNSS jamming, also referred as intentional jamming, is when a jammer generates sufficiently powerful disruptive noise signals at frequency bands used by a GNSS system in order to prevent GNSS receivers from tracking signals and calculating reliable navigation data. As for GNSS spoofing, unlike jamming, deceives the receiver into calculating an incorrect navigation data by generating a false signal that is either created by a signal generator or is a replica of a real recorded GNSS signal. The need for Terrain Referenced Navigation (TRN) arises when these GNSS signals are unavailable, jammed or blocked. In recent years, research on the application of TRN to aerial vehicles has been increased rapidly with the developments in the accuracy of digital terrain elevation database (DTED). Since the land profile is inherently nonlinear, TRN becomes a nonlinear estimation problem. Because of the highly nonlinear problem, linear or linearized estimation techniques such as Kalman or Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) do not work properly for many terrain profiles. In our previously published works, we already presented the nonlinear estimation techniques that can be suitable for the solution of TRN problem. In this paper, we move onto the real-time application of TRN algorithm and present an overview of the real-time flight test results. Thanks to our previous research, a nonlinear filtering method namely the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) based on the Unscented Transform (UT) of sigma points is selected and utilized for the real-time solution of problem due to its simplicity and low processor capacity requirement. The designed UKF algorithm is used to provide essentially continuous terrain navigation through closed-loop estimation of navigation errors in combination with fixed-angle-mounted laser altimeter ground clearance measurements and onboard Level-1 DTED obtained from open internet resources. A real-time implementation of the algorithm is integrated into a general aviation aircraft equipped with a commercial fiber-optic navigation grade INS using a multi-frequency, multi-constellation GNSS receiver. By means of this system, the performance of the algorithm is monitored during real-time flight test. The recorded flight data show that the implemented TRN algorithm successfully estimates the aircraft horizontal position states with an accuracy of less than DTED resolution.  © 2023 IEEE.},

Specific faults are investigated in power lines where a transformer is connected and only the primary electrical quantities, input voltage, and current are measured. Faults can occur in either the primary or secondary winding of the transformer. Two EKFs are proposed for fault detection. The first EKF estimates the voltage, current, and electrical load resistance of the secondary winding using measurements of the primary winding. The model of the transformer used is known as mutual inductance. For a short circuit in the secondary winding, the observer generates a signal indicating a fault. The second EKF is designed for harmonic detection and estimates the amplitude and frequency of the primary winding voltage. This contribution focuses on mathematical methods useful for galvanic decoupled soft sensing and fault detection. Moreover, the contribution emphasizes how EKF observers play a key role in the context of sensor fusion, which is characterized by merging multiple lines of information in an accurate conceptualization of data and their reconciliation with the measurements. Simulations demonstrate the efficiency of the fault detection using EKF observers. © 2023 by the authors.},

In a finite population model, the goal is to estimate the joint distribution of the population state and the state of a typical individual. The observation equations are a noisy measurement of the population. The general results are applied to demand dispatch for regulation of the power grid, based on randomized local control algorithms. In prior work by the authors it has been shown that local control can be carefully designed so that the aggregate of loads behaves as a controllable resource with accuracy matching or exceeding traditional sources of frequency regulation. The operational cost is nearly zero in many cases. The information exchange between grid and load is minimal, but it is assumed in the overall control architecture that the aggregate power consumption of loads is available to the grid operator. It is shown that the Kalman filter can be constructed to reduce these communication requirements, and to provide the grid operator with accurate estimates of the mean and variance of quality of service (QoS) for an individual load. © 2015 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Fast and accurate acquisition of the frequency, amplitude and phase angle of power signal is of great significance for popularization and application of synchronous phasor measurement technology in distribution network. Distribution network signal has the characteristics of high noise, strong transient, etc. The performance of current algorithm in real-time tracking of transient signals is not ideal. This paper analyzes the signal parameter estimation problem in strong transient environment and proposes a modified strong tracking unscented Kalman filter (MSTUKF) algorithm. Firstly, the basic principle of strong tracking filter (STF) is analyzed. Then, based on unscented transform theory, an STF algorithm is equivalently deduced. On this basis, a fast tracking algorithm for mutation of frequency, amplitude and phase angle is proposed for the case where the state equation is linear and the measurement equation is nonlinear. Introduction of fading factor into sigma point set makes the algorithm only need to perform an unscented transformation, thus simplifying the calculation. At the same time, the fading factor is introduced into the output covariance matrix to improve stability of the algorithm when the system parameters are mutational. Simulation results show that the proposed synchronized phasor measurement algorithm can quickly track frequency, amplitude and phase angle with good convergence and high measurement accuracy. © 2019, Power System Technology Press.

	abstract = {One of primary grid management challenge is to ensure that these changing power system operating conditions stay within safe limits at all times including potential and probable future contingencies. In this field, one of the most promising enabling technologies is synchrophasor measurements, which require the estimation of the parameters of sinusoids, namely amplitude, frequency and phase. In the context of synchrophasor measurements many algorithms have been proposed, which are based on the computation of Discrete Fourier Transform, on the digital phase-locked loop, the Kalman filter, estimation of sinusoid parameters in noisy environment. In this paper we propose a phasor estimation algorithm based on the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) assumption. We show that such an assumption reduces the computational complexity of the algorithm in terms of products per observation window. Amplitude can be estimated as sample-mean of the sequence of magnitude of the observed samples, thus requiring just sums, and frequency and phase can be estimated sequentially from the observed phases only. Monte-Carlo simulations show that the proposed algorithm achieves the Cramer-Rao Lower Bounds for amplitude, frequency and phase and estimated total vector error is well below the limits prescribed in standard in both static and dynamic conditions. © 2016 IEEE.},

Therefore, this study gives insight to the design and implementation of the discrete wavelet transform (DWT)- based denoising technique for noise reduction of the DCV. The steps of denoising of noisy DCV for proposed study are follows. Firstly, by using the multi-resolution analysis (MRA), the noiseriding DCV signal is decomposed into different frequency subbands. Specifically, the signal processing considering high frequency component that focuses on short-time interval is absolutely necessary in order to reduce noise of the DCV. Secondly, the hard-thresholding based denoising technique is used to adjust the wavelet coefficients of the DWT for a clear separation between the signal and the noise. Thirdly, the desired de-noised DCV signal is reconstructed by taking the inverse DWT on filtered detailed coefficients. Consequently, this signal is applied to the equivalent circuit model (ECM)-based SOC estimation algorithm using the extended Kalman filter (EKF). Experimental results indicate the robustness of the proposed work. © 2015 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The planetary gearbox, due to its unique mechanical structures, is an important rotating machine for transmission systems. Its engineering applications are often in non-stationary operational conditions, such as helicopters, wind energy systems, etc. The unique physical structures and working conditions make the vibrations measured from planetary gearboxes exhibit a complex time-varying modulation and therefore yield complicated spectral structures. As a result, traditional signal processing methods, such as Fourier analysis, and the selection of characteristic fault frequencies for diagnosis face serious challenges. To overcome this drawback, this paper proposes a signal selection scheme for fault-emphasized diagnostics based upon two order tracking techniques. The basic procedures for the proposed scheme are as follows. (1) Computed order tracking is applied to reveal the order contents and identify the order(s) of interest. (2) Vold-Kalman filter order tracking is used to extract the order(s) of interest - these filtered order(s) constitute the so-called selected vibrations. (3) Time domain statistic indicators are applied to the selected vibrations for faulty information-emphasized diagnostics. The proposed scheme is explained and demonstrated in a signal simulation model and experimental studies and the method proves to be effective for planetary gearbox fault diagnosis. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this research would be to dynamically assess the efficacy of interconnection networks using a range of important measures. The goal of this study was to provide recommendations for enhancing electricity transmission throughout the electrical grid. Connectivity between the wind farm and the grid is complete. The methods used in this research are Grid-interlinked DFIG Dynamic State Estimation, Optimal Substation Size and Location, and 3C's Aware Wind Turbine Aggregation. Land form, wind speed, wind direction, and weather characteristics - which describe the weather at a particular time - are examples of environmental features. The wind turbines are grouped by combining the K Nearest Neighbor method and the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (also known as KNN-DBSCAN), which facilitates effective aggregation of wind turbines.Frequency variation is caused by the power imbalance between the grid and the installed wind turbines. The Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU), which is in charge of the system's overall observability, is likewise housed in the substation. So, attaining reliability inside the grid-connected wind farms relies heavily on deciding on the scope and placement of substations. The bio-inspired meta-heuristic optimisation algorithm Mayfly Optimization Technique (MOA) is used for this purpose. To accomplish the dynamic state estimate, the transmitter level power and grid characteristics are predicted. The quality of power generated by a wind power system linked to the grid is evaluated using dynamic state estimation. Power characteristics such pitch angle, wind speed, voltage variation, notching, harmonics, frequency variation, noise, and terminal voltages were forecasted using the Dueling Deep Q Network. The grid's short circuit impedance, inertia level, and X/R ratio are assessed using the Unscented Kalman Filter - Eigen analysis.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In multicore processor systems, being able to accurately predict the future provides new optimization opportunities, which otherwise could not be exploited. For example, an oracle able to predict a certain application's behavior running on a smart phone could direct the power manager to switch to appropriate dynamic voltage and frequency scaling modes that would guarantee minimum levels of desired performance while saving energy consumption and thereby prolonging battery life. Using predictions enables systems to become proactive rather than continue to operate in a reactive manner. This prediction-based proactive approach has become increasingly popular in the design and optimization of integrated circuits and of multicore processor systems. Prediction transforms from simple forecasting to sophisticated machine learning based prediction and classification that learns from existing data, employs data mining, and predicts future behavior. This can be exploited by novel optimization techniques that can span across all layers of the computing stack. In this survey paper, we present a discussion of the most popular techniques on prediction and classification in the general context of computing systems with emphasis on multicore processors.

	abstract = {The electrification of vehicles puts forward higher requirements for the power management efficiency of integrated battery management systems as the primary or sole energy supply. In this paper, an efficient adaptive multi-time scale identification strategy is proposed to achieve high-fidelity modeling of complex kinetic processes inside the battery. More specifically, a second-order equivalent circuit model network considering variable characteristic frequency is constructed based on the high-frequency, medium-high-frequency, and low-frequency characteristics of the key kinetic processes. Then, two coupled sub-filters are developed based on forgetting factor recursive least squares and extended Kalman filtering methods and decoupled by the corresponding time-scale information. The coupled iterative calculation of the two sub-filter modules at different time scales is realized by the voltage response of the kinetic diffusion process. In addition, the driver of the low-frequency subalgorithm with the state of charge variation amount as the kernel is designed to realize the adaptive identification of the kinetic diffusion process parameters. Finally, the concept of dynamical parameter entropy is introduced and advocated to verify the physical meaning of the kinetic parameters. The experimental results under three operating conditions show that the mean absolute error and root-mean-square error metrics of the proposed strategy for voltage tracking can be limited to 13 and 16 mV, respectively. Additionally, from the entropy calculation results, the proposed method can reduce the dispersion of parameter identification results by a maximum of 40.72% and 70.05%, respectively, compared with the traditional fixed characteristic frequency algorithms. The proposed method paves the way for the subsequent development of adaptive state estimators and efficient embedded applications. © 2023 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences},

Massive MIMO systems, however, may require a large number of radio frequency (RF) chains that could cause high cost and power consumption issues. One of promising approaches to resolve these issues is using low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) at base stations. Channel estimation becomes a difficult task by using low-resolution ADCs though. This paper addresses the channel estimation problem for massive MIMO systems using one-bit ADCs when the channels are spatially and temporally correlated. Based on the Bussgang decomposition, which reformulates a non-linear one-bit quantization to a statistically equivalent linear operator, the Kalman filter is used to estimate the spatially and temporally correlated channel by assuming the quantized noise follows a Gaussian distribution. Numerical results show that the proposed technique can improve the channel estimation quality significantly by properly exploiting the spatial and temporal correlations of channels. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This article proposes an electrical signature analysis method for open-circuit faults (OCFs) detection of inverter with various disturbances in distribution grid. According to the fault mechanism, the fundamental value, rated harmonics, and direct current component of three-phase currents are used as fault electrical signatures. The signatures are estimated by unscented Kalman filter (UKF) and recognized by extreme learning machine (ELM) for fault detection. Both OCF of single switch and OCFs of multiple switches are tested with consideration of direct disturbances such as load change, overcurrent and bias current, and indirect disturbances such as grid frequency variation, background harmonics, and unbalanced voltage dip. The simulations and experiments show that the OCF detection of the new method is still accurate even with these disturbances, and reveal that only the signatures of the faulty phase current are immune to the disturbances while the ones of unfaulty phases are not. The robustness when facing the various disturbances and all explainable detection results make the new method suitable and effective for OCF of inverter detection in complicated distribution grid environment.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Normal operation conditions of cognitive radio applications require signal processing techniques that can be executed in real time. One of the first steps is to sense the occupied or free frequency channels. Two major drawbacks in the current techniques are that they assume (i) the noise as white and (ii) the measured spectrum as time-invariant. In real world, the noise is (i) colored so it disturbs the signal unevenly and (ii) its spectrum changes over time. Hence, tracking the time-varying noise spectrum can become crucial to remove the noise contributions and enhance the estimate of the received signal. In this paper, we study an auto-regressive model to develop an adaptive noise tracking technique using a Kalman filter such that an extension of Boll's noise subtraction technique, designed for audio noise cancellation, becomes feasible when adjusted to cognitive radio scenarios. Simulation results show the performance of this technique. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The main objective of this work is to propose a reliable routine standard operation procedures (SOP) for structural health monitoring and diagnosis of nuclear power plants (NPPs). At present, NPPs have monitoring systems that can be used to obtain the quantitative health record of containment (CTMT) buildings through system identification technology. However, because the measurement signals are often interfered with by noise, the identification results may introduce erroneous conclusions if the measured data is directly adopted. Therefore, this paper recommends the SOP for signal screening and the required identification procedures to identify the dynamic characteristics of the CTMT of NPPs. In the SOP, three recommend methods are proposed including the Recursive Least Squares (RLS), the Observer Kalman Filter Identification/Eigensystem Realization Algorithm (OKID/ERA), and the Frequency Response Function (FRF). The identification results can be verified by comparing the results of different methods. Finally, a preliminary CTMT healthy record can be established based on the limited number of earthquake records. It can be served as the quantitative reference to expedite the restart procedure. If the fundamental frequency of the CTMT drops significantly after the Operating Basis Earthquake and Safe Shutdown Earthquake (OBE/SSE), it means that the restart actions suggested by the regulatory guide should be taken in place immediately. © 2020},

	abstract = {A new approach is proposed in this paper based on radiation modes to control the radiated sound pressure of a smart cylindrical shell equipped with piezoelectric sensor and actuators. The radiation modes determine the specific distribution of normal velocity of the shell that independently radiates sound to the surrounding space. In this study, the first radiation mode is controlled since it is the most effective mode in terms of the radiated power. The results indicate that most of the sound power is attenuated by controlling only this mode. The extended Hamilton's principle, the Sanders shell theory and the assumed mode method are used to derive the equations of motion in a state space form that is suitable to design the controller. The radiated sound pressure is calculated using the simplified Kirchhoff-Helmholtz integral along with a Kalman filter to observe the system states, and a modified higher harmonic control (MHHC) is designed to attenuate the sound power. A numerical simulation demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to active vibration control (AVC) in attenuating the radiated sound in the low frequency domain. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

KFbased tracking is employed for accurate frequency estimation of both harmonic and inter-harmonic components in a Compressive Sensing Taylor Fourier Multifrequency (CSTFM) algorithm. This novel approach improves robustness of the CSTFM method to the effects of spectral interference among harmonic and interharmonic components, allowing better estimates of each component and extending the range of application beyond pure phasor measurement unit (PMU) devices. Computational efficiency compared to a plain CSTFM algorithm is also enhanced. Significant case studies, with signals including timevarying harmonic and interharmonic components, are analyzed and discussed with regards, in particular, to frequency estimation. Moreover, it is shown that intermittent components can be handled without loss of accuracy by KF-based tracking features. © 2015 IEEE.},

We demonstrate that commercial buildings can track a frequency regulation signal with high accuracy and minimal occupant discomfort in a realistic environment. In addition, we show that buildings can determine the reserve capacity and baseline power a priori, and identify the optimal tradeoff between frequency regulation and energy efficiency. In part I, we introduce the test facility and develop relevant building models. Furthermore, we design a hierarchical controller for the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system that consists of three levels: 1) a reserve scheduler; 2) a building climate controller; and 3) a fan speed controller for frequency regulation. We formulate the reserve scheduler as a robust optimization problem and introduce several approximations to reduce its complexity. The building climate controller is comprised of a robust model predictive controller and a Kalman filter. The frequency regulation controller consists of a feedback and a feedforward loop, provides fast responses, and is stable. Part I presents building model identification and controller tuning results. Specifically, we find out that with an appropriate formulation of the model identification problem, a two-state model is accurate enough for use in a reserve scheduler that runs day-ahead. In part II, we report results from the operation of the hierarchical controller under frequency regulation. © 2010-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Background Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been shown to perturb both cortical neural activity and hemodynamics during (online) and after the stimulation, however mechanisms of these tDCS-induced online and after-effects are not known. Here, online resting-state spontaneous brain activation may be relevant to monitor tDCS neuromodulatory effects that can be measured using electroencephalography (EEG) in conjunction with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Method We present a Kalman Filter based online parameter estimation of an autoregressive (ARX) model to track the transient coupling relation between the changes in EEG power spectrum and NIRS signals during anodal tDCS (2 mA, 10 min) using a 4 × 1 ring high-definition montage. Results Our online ARX parameter estimation technique using the cross-correlation between log (base-10) transformed EEG band-power (0.5–11.25 Hz) and NIRS oxy-hemoglobin signal in the low frequency (≤0.1 Hz) range was shown in 5 healthy subjects to be sensitive to detect transient EEG-NIRS coupling changes in resting-state spontaneous brain activation during anodal tDCS. Conventional sliding window cross-correlation calculations suffer a fundamental problem in computing the phase relationship as the signal in the window is considered time-invariant and the choice of the window length and step size are subjective. Here, Kalman Filter based method allowed online ARX parameter estimation using time-varying signals that could capture transients in the coupling relationship between EEG and NIRS signals. Conclusion Our new online ARX model based tracking method allows continuous assessment of the transient coupling between the electrophysiological (EEG) and the hemodynamic (NIRS) signals representing resting-state spontaneous brain activation during anodal tDCS. © 2016},

	abstract = {Due to the rapid development of wind power, the stable operation of doubly fed induction generators (DFIGs) has attracted much attention. This paper focuses on the finite frequency (FF) H∞ control for the DFIG with input delay, aiming to reduce the effects of current harmonic interferences and gain disturbances on the DFIG and improve the stability of the system. First, a DFIG state–space model with input delay under current harmonics was constructed. Second, based on the DFIG state–space model, an FF H∞ state-feedback controller was designed from the frequency domain perspective, which makes the DFIG stable and robust against harmonic interferences and gain disturbances. Third, via the generalized Kalman–Yakubovich–Popov (GKYP) lemma and the Lyapunov theory, the FF H∞ performance was evaluated in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), and then the state feedback FF H∞ controller was designed. Finally, the simulation results showed the efficiency of the proposed approach. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Abstract: In the study of micro-scale biological flows, velocimetry methods based on passive tracers, such as micro-PIV and micro-PTV, are well established to characterize steady flows. However, these methods become inappropriate for measuring unsteady flows of small amplitude, because, on these scales, the motion of passive tracers cannot be distinguished from Brownian motion. In this study, we use optical tweezers (OTs) in combination with Kalman filtering, to measure unsteady microscopic flows with high temporal accuracy. This method is referred to as optical tweezers-based velocimetry (OTV). The OTV method measures the nanometric displacements of a trapped bead, and predicts the instantaneous velocity of the flow by employing a Kalman filter. We discuss the accuracy of OTV in measuring unsteady flows with 1.5–70 μ m s- 1 amplitudes and 10–90 Hz frequencies. We quantify how the bead size and the laser power affect the velocimetry accuracy, and specify the optimal choices for the bead size and laser power to measure different unsteady flows. OTV accurately measures unsteady flows with amplitudes as small as 3–6 μ m s- 1. We compare the accuracy of OTV and micro-PTV, and characterize the flow regime for which OTV outperforms micro-PTV. We also demonstrate the robustness of OTV by measuring the unsteady flow created by the cilia of green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, and comparing with numerical predictions based on Stokes equations. An open-source implementation of the OTV software in Matlab is available through the 4TU.Centre for Research Data. Graphic abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.]. © 2020, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {With the advantages of excellent insulation performance, wide dynamic measurement range, good frequency response characteristics and high sensitivity, fiber optic current transducer (FOCT) has become the mainstream of current measurement technology. The structure of fiber-optic current transformer is complex, and random error becomes one of the major problems that affect the application of fiber-optic current transformers in power engineering. It is urgent to study the random error characteristics of fiber current transformers and propose effective measures to suppress random errors. The characteristics of random error in FOCT are analyzed, and time series model is established by preprocessing and statistical inspection of FOCT output data. Based on the random error characteristics of the FOCT output signal, it makes prerequisite preparation for the signal filtering optimization modelling and the construction of the state function equation. With the derived random error state function of FOCT, the Wavelet filtering algorithm combining with Kalman filtering algorithm is proposed, then, the time domain and frequency domain local area transforms are used to detect the random error characteristics and identify various types of random error information accurately. Real-time multi-scale decomposition and optimal estimation of random error in FOCT are realized. Experimental results demonstrate that the time series modelling and Wavelet filtering algorithm can accurately identify the random error characteristics of the FOCT and automatically match the parameter filtering to improve current measurement accuracy. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

	abstract = {Microgrids must be able to restore voltage and frequency to their reference values during transient events; inverters are used as part of a microgrid's hierarchical control for maintaining power quality. Reviewed methods either do not allow for intuitive trade-off tuning between the objectives of synchronous state restoration, local reference tracking, and disturbance rejection, or do not consider all of these objectives. In this paper, we address all of these objectives for voltage restoration in droop-controlled inverter-based islanded micro-grids. By using distributed model predictive control (DMPC) in series with an unscented Kalman Filter (UKF), we design a secondary voltage controller to restore the voltage to the reference in finite time. The DMPC solves a reference tracking problem while rejecting reactive power disturbances in a noisy system. The method we present accounts for non-zero mean disturbances by design of a random-walk estimator. We validate the method's ability to restore the voltage in finite time via modeling a multi-node microgrid in Simulink. © 2019 IEEE.},

It is essential to pre-process the data before being used by critical applications for situational awareness and control. In this work, two approaches for detection of data anomalies are introduced for offline (larger data processing window) and online (shorter data processing window) applications. A margin-based maximum likelihood estimator (MB-MLE) method is developed to detect anomalies by integrating the results of different base detectors including Hampel filter, Quartile detector and DBSCAN. A smoothing wavelet denoising method is used to remove high-frequency noises. The processed data with offline analysis is used to fit a model to the underlying dynamics of synchrophasor data using Koopman Mode Analysis, which is subsequently employed for online denoising and bad data detection (BDD) using Kalman Filter (KF). The parameters of the KF are adjusted adaptively based on similarity to the training data set for model fitting purposes. Developed techniques have been validated for the modified IEEE test system with multiple D-PMUs, modeled and simulated in real-time for different case scenarios using the OPAL-RT Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIL) Simulator. © 2021 IEEE.},

In two-stage beamforming, a new algorithm for statistical pre-beamformer design is proposed for spatially correlated time-varying wideband MIMO channels under the assumption that the channel is a stationary Gauss-Markov random process. The proposed algorithm yields a nearly optimal pre-beamformer whose beam pattern is designed sequentially with low complexity by taking the user-grouping into account, and exploiting the properties of Kalman filtering and associated prediction error covariance matrices. The resulting design, based on the second order statistical properties of the channel, generates beamspace on which the RR Kalman estimator can be realized as accurately as possible. It is observed that the adaptive channel estimation technique together with the proposed sequential beamspace construction shows remarkable robustness to the pilot interference. This comes with significant reduction in both pilot overhead and dimension of the pre-beamformer lowering both hardware complexity and power consumption. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Accurately estimating the internal parameters is very important for electric vehicles, which can not only guarantee that the State Of Charge (SOC) of the power battery is maintained within a reasonable range of the operation to avoid the risk of the overcharge or the deep discharge of the power battery, but also both improve the efficiency and extend the life of the battery. In this paper, the static model is obtained by transforming the first-order RC equivalent circuit model in the frequency domain, which is only associated with the voltage and the current. The adaptive Kalman filter is applied to implement the online identification of the parameters and Open-Circuit Voltage (OCV) in the static model. The OCV-SOC model is established by the neural network. The SOC is obtained by the OCV-SOC neural network model with an estimation error of approximately 8%. The current feed-forward method is introduced to compensate the SOC for improving the estimation precision. The simulation experimental results show that this scheme has a higher precision and a simpler structure. The proposed method provides an approach for estimating the SOC by the OCV, which takes fully into account the hysteresis characteristics of the OCV-SOC model during the dynamic condition in the long charge and discharge process of the battery for electric vehicles. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, London.},

	abstract = {A new control algorithm for operation of surface mounted permanent magnet synchronous machines in very low speed and standstill using finite control set model predictive control (FCS-MPC) and high frequency signal injection for estimation of the rotor position is proposed. Estimation of the rotor position is based on the standard injections of high frequency signal into the voltage command for a PWM. It is intended to achieve the same effect using the FCS-MPC. The FCS-MPC usually operates with a short sampling period, therefore the estimation algorithm needs to be computationally cheap. Moreover, the cost function needs to be modified to secure injection of high frequency (hf) voltage signals into a given axis in a reference frame linked with the rotor position. In this paper, a method of injection of a harmonic signal using FCS-MPC is proposed, using an extension of the cost function. Rotor position and speed estimation is based on the conventional phase-locked loop. Theoretical assumptions are verified by both simulations and experiments on a laboratory prototype of PMSM drive with rated power of 250 W. © 2015 IEEE.},

We focus on opportunities to centrally control loads with high accuracy but low requirements for sensing and communications infrastructure. We compare cases when measured load state information (e.g., power consumption and temperature) is 1) available in real time; 2) available, but not in real time; and 3) not available. We use Markov chain models to describe the temperature state evolution of populations of TCLs, and Kalman filtering for both state and joint parameter/state estimation. A look-ahead proportional controller broadcasts control signals to all TCLs, which always remain in their temperature dead-band. Simulations indicate that it is possible to achieve power tracking RMS errors in the range of 0.26%-9.3% of steady state aggregated power consumption. We also report results in terms of the generator compliance threshold which is commonly used in industry. Results depend upon the information available for system identification, state estimation, and control. Depending upon the performance required, TCLs may not need to provide state information to the central controller in real time or at all. © 2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) has been proposed as one of the key technologies for the next generation wireless communication systems. Uniform planar array (UPA) antenna structures have been considered in many researches because it is able to deploy a large number of antennas in a relatively small area. There are lots of performance superiorities in massive MIMO systems. However, in practice, these superiorities is achieved only when the uplink and downlink channel state information (CSI) are known perfectly by both the base station (BS) and users. In frequency division duplex (FDD) massive MIMO systems, a large percentage of precious downlink capacity is reserved by training sequence for channel estimation due to the large number of antennas. In this paper, a design method of optimal training sequence is studied based on the downlink closed-loop training scheme with UPA, in which the Kalman filter is used for CSI acquisition. Simulation results show that the proposed optimal training sequence based on the closed-loop training scheme outperforms the existing ones. © 2016 IEEE.},

Online prognosis requires identification of fault precursors which shows sensitivity to degradation. Although gate threshold voltage and gate leakage current are identified as fault precursors, Extraction methods of these parameters are offline. In this paper, on-state resistance (RDS,ON) is investigated as an online fault precursor for GaN HEMT. Temperature variation during its operation results in irreversible damage to GaN HEMT.

	abstract = {In the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based localization of slow-moving radio frequency (RF) sources with unknown transmitted strength of signal, such as a person with a cell phone in a search and rescue mission, the UAV navigation errors are significant sources of localization error. Although the use of a global positioning system (GPS) can reduce the UAV's localization error significantly resulting in more accurate RF source localization, if the GPS signal is lost temporarily or permanently, the accuracy of the UAV-based localization decreases rapidly. In this paper, a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)-inspired approach for simultaneous localization of UAV and RF sources (SLUS) is proposed. The proposed approach solves these two connected problems, i.e. the UAV localization and RF source localization, simultaneously to decrease the error of the UAV position estimation and the error of the RF source localization. In the proposed approach, beside the UAV position prediction, the RF source position prediction is also performed. Then the predicted states are augmented and the augmented predicted state information is corrected using range-ratio and bearing observations, i.e. RF source features, considering the unknown transmitted power. The proposed approach is simulated and the results show that the normal divergence of a target localization and the divergence of the UAV navigation in latitude and longitude channels have been eliminated using this approach. In other words, simultaneous localization of the UAV and RF sources uses the RF sources, as features in the environment, to aid the navigation system. Although the approach is similar to the mapping of RF sources in the environment, the created map would be useless after finding the RF sources. That is why SLUS has been used instead of SLAM. The main contributions of this work are: 1) performing simultaneous localization of a UAV and targets using RF signals, especially in a non-line of sight (NLOS) condition; 2) using difference of signal strength, i.e. differential received strength signal indicator (DRSSI), to eliminate the impact of unknown target signal power; and 3) simultaneous multi-target localization and tracking. © 2016 SAGE Publications.},

With the initial frequency-domain beam space channel estimates, Kalman-based algorithms are further developed to track the transmit and receive beamforming directions and the channel coefficients of the sparse propagation paths in mmWave mobile channels. Simulations show that the proposed method can greatly reduce the beam training time, and that the channel capacity evaluated with the estimated channels is only 2 dB inferior to the one with ideal channels.

The converter is designed to operate in voltage-control mode for a UPS application with an output LC filter. Current-sensorless operation is achieved through the implementation of a full order state-space observer. The state-space model is also used for two-step ahead prediction of filter capacitor voltage which is used as a reference to the Phase Shifted PWM (PSPWM) modulator. The use of PSPWM modulator guarantees balancing of the flying capacitors (FC's) inherently thus removing the need for additional sensors required to measure FC's voltages.

	abstract = {Ultra-short and short-term wind speed prediction is important in wind power systems, especially for turbine control and primary frequency regulation. Wind farms have more drastic wind speed variations and spatial features to be explored because the turbines are affected by spatial wake effects. For the characteristics of wind speed and wake effect, this paper proposes a TCN-ARIMA prediction model based on Kalman filter and graph convolutional neural network (GCN). Because of the instability of wind speed, the wind speed signal is divided into the principal component part and the unstable part by Kalman filtering, where the principal component part contains most of the information, and the spatial features between turbine and turbine are extracted by using multi-layer graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs); the temporal convolutional neural network TCN is used to predict the principal component, and for the unstable part containing disturbances part, the adaptive auto-ARIMA model is used to extract the temporal residual information that may be contained, Finally, the output is superimposed. The analysis shows that the method improves the capability of conventional wind speed prediction, and the auto-ARIMA model can also capture the residual time-series information, and the achieved prediction results have significant advantages.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Cooperating radios can extend their communication range by adjusting their signals to ensure coherent combining at a destination radio. This technique is called distributed transmit beamforming. Beamforming (BF) relies on the BF radios having frequency synchronized carriers and phases adjusted for coherent combining. Both requirements are typically met by exchanging preambles with the destination. However, since BF aims to increase the received power, the individually transmitted preambles are typically at low SNR and their lengths are constrained by the channel coherence time. These noisy preambles lead to errors in frequency and phase estimation, which result in randomly changing BF gains. To build reliable distributed BF systems, the impact of estimation errors on the BF gains need to be considered in the design. In this work, assuming a destination-led BF protocol and Kalman filter for frequency tracking, we optimize the number of BF radios and the preamble lengths to achieve reliable BF gain. To do that, we characterize the relations between the BF gains distribution, the channel coherence time, and design parameters like the SNR, preamble lengths, and the number of radios. The proposed relations are verified using simulations and via experiments using software-defined radios in a lab and on UAVs. © 2002-2012 IEEE.},

This research uses one-dimensional Kalman filter to remove EMG noise after preliminary filtering and QRS complex wave recognition of real-time ECG signal. In this research, the low pass and high-pass FIR filter are used firstly to suppress power line and high frequency interference. Then a median filter is used to delete baseline wander. A Kaiser window is also used to prevent spectrum leakage. After these pre-processing, the wavelet transform method is used to initially identify the R peaks, Q peaks and S peaks. Since EMG noise is similar as white noise as to ECG, Kalman filter is suitable to remove EMG in real time. We generate an EMG noise database by adding EMG noise from Noise Stress Test database to clean ECG data in MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database. We test the ECG data in EMG noise database and 1475 ECG data collected by a portable ECG card. Without weakening the R peaks, the EMG noise is suppressed successfully, while P-peaks can be automatically identified with the smooth signal, which helps to identify premature ventricular contraction (PVC). The sensitivity and positive predict value (+P) of QRS recognition and P recognition of EMG noise database are all above 99%. © 2018 Creative Commons Attribution.},

To achieve the desired performance, the proposed control strategy for the indirect frequency converter aims to accomplish two crucial goals. Firstly, it must ensure a highly responsive actuator with exceptional dynamic characteristics. Secondly, it must establish appropriate electromagnetic compatibility with the grid and the possibility of energy recuperation. Considering that the simulator is intended to be used in collaboration with a training crew, it becomes paramount to prioritize the reliability and safety of its operation. However, ensuring the reliability of the linear actuator's winding (slider) position sensor, which can be particularly challenging in this context, is crucial. As a solution, the control algorithm of the converter's output section has been extended to incorporate sensorless position and velocity estimation. This addition addresses the challenge of the position sensor mechanical installation and enhances the system's overall reliability. Selected experimental tests proved the proposed converter control system. © 2023 IEEE.},

The frequency signatures in rotor field current are well known indicators to detect and diagnose stator winding short circuits in synchronous generators, in addition the damper bars current could also be used for fault detection and diagnosis. However, BWFSG these currents are not accessible. Hence, it is important to use the mathematical model and state estimation techniques to estimate these parameters. This paper compares the performance of state estimation techniques such as the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Particle Filter (PF) in estimating field current and damper bars current for stator winding fault detection and diagnosis. The experimental validation results confirmed that the performance of the EKF is better than that of the PF in terms of number of stator winding fault signatures extracted from estimating the field current and damper bars currents.

	abstract = {This paper proposes a novel active islanding fault detection method based on even harmonics injection and set-membership filtering for the distributed generation systems. Traditional active islanding detections are mainly adding disturbances to frequency or phase of the voltage reference signal. The proposed active method detects islanding fault by injecting even-order harmonics into the current reference signal and monitoring the changes of corresponding voltage harmonics using set-membership filtering. This paper gives the principle of this proposed detection method and analyzes the range of injected even harmonics. We compare the differences of the even-order harmonic voltage between grid-connected and grid-off conditions. The proposed method has a number of advantages such as fast detection speed, almost no non-detection zone, and little impact on power quality. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by MATLAB/Simulink simulations. Kalman filtering contrast experiments are presented to confirm that the set-membership filtering is more effective in islanding detection. © 2014 IEEE.},

Either the problem is formulated as a non-convex problem with difficulty in solving or relaxed as a convex problem with a price of some conservativeness. In this contribution, a new minimum power input design problem is formulated by viewing the input as a stochastic process. We seek the minimum energy input with variance constraints over a frequency band. By exploiting the generalized Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov lemma, the stochastic consideration facilitates the input design problem to be presented as a convex problem whose decision variables are a finite number of autocorrelation coefficients. We obtain the autocorrelation coefficients of the desired stochastic input signal by solving the convex problem and extend them by the maximum entropy extension. Then, a specific identification input is sampled from the obtained stochastic process. Simulations results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

	abstract = {Formation flying missions involve relative navigation, or the determination of the relative kinematic state of the spacecraft involved. Different options do exist, both in visible and conventional radio-frequency operations, with passive and active architectures. All the solutions need to take into account the strict requirements in terms of mass, volume and power typical to spacecraft, not to forget that they are not directly part of the payload, so that the overall impact of this avionic subsystem needs to be minimized. This paper aims to discuss a simple solution for the relative navigation of a formation, especially suitable for moderate cost, moderate performance missions (like the ones exploited by cubesats). A field strength meter onboard the chief-satellite can provide the level of received signal power, which is an observable related - even if with a poor quality - to the inter-satellite distance. An extended Kalman filter including a suitable dynamical model can exploit these measurements in order to estimate the formation kinematic state at a very limited cost. The combination of the two elements makes up for a technique which is accurate enough even in the phases immediately following the release from the launcher, where the spacecraft are in close proximity. The presented numerical simulation proves the valuable performance of such a simple system, also useful as a possible back-up solution at a limited cost in terms of spacecraft requirements. © 2015 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The high-cycle bending fatigue experiment is one of the most important necessary steps in guiding the crankshaft manufacturing process, especially for high-power engines. In this paper, an accelerated method was proposed to shorten the time period of this experiment. First, the loading period was quickened through the prediction of the residual fatigue life based on the unscented Kalman filtering algorithm approach and the crack growth speed. Then, the accuracy of the predictions was improved obviously based on the modified training section based on the theory of fracture mechanics. Finally, the fatigue limit load analysis result was proposed based on the predicted fatigue life and the modified SAFL (statistical analysis for the fatigue limit) method. The main conclusion proposed from this paper is that compared with the conventional training sections, the modified training sections based on the theory of fracture mechanics can obviously improve the accuracy of the remaining fatigue life prediction results, which makes this approach more suitable for the application. In addition, compared with the system’s inherent natural frequency, the fatigue crack can save the experiment time more effectively and thus is superior to the former factor as the failure criterion parameter. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {When GSC is connected to weak grid, the small signal instability can happen due to incompatible terminal characteristic of GSC and the grid impedance. Since higher disturbance rejection capability of GSC benefits the resolving of such stability problem, finite set model predictive control (FS-MPC) is applied. However, in weak grid, conventional FS-MPC shows poor performance as the total harmonic distortion (THD) of GSC output current is too high. To solve the problem, Kalman filter (KF) is used. The filtered signals are fed into the predictive controller instead of the directly measured current and voltage, which significantly reduce the harmonic distortion of GSC output current in the middle frequency range around 300600Hz. Besides, in order to reduce the THD of output current, a three-level neutral point clamped (3L-NPC) grid side converter (GSC) is used. A simple sequential finite set prediction is applied to reduce the computational burden. The performance of proposed strategy is verified by simulation. Moreover, the impedance characteristic of the proposed MPC controller is presented, which is obtained by the perturbation test. From impedance viewpoint, the stability performance of proposed method in weak grid is analyzed, which is found promising. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In today's competitive business environment creating memorable experiences and emotional connections1 with consumers is critical to win consumer spending and long term brand loyalty [1]. Brands want their customers to be in pleasing subliminal scented2 environments because, as research has shown, even a few micro-particles of scent can do a lot of marketing's heavy lifting, from improving consumer perceptions of quality to increasing the number of store visits. Hence, customer venues such as hotels, retail showrooms, casinos, hospitable and other captive audience places employ HVAC (Heating, ventilation and air conditioning) based scent diffusion system that delivers a seamless olfactory [2] experience to connect with consumers on a deeper emotional level, resulting in a more memorable experience. Current state of the art of HVAC dispenser systems, however, uses power hungry deployments [3] to monitor and dispense periodically, without accounting venue-patron occupancy ratios and sudden changes in foot traffic numbers. Thus, resulting sub-optimal user experience that might lead to a poor brand engagement and could incur higher operational costs [5] and thus reduce over all return on the investment (ROI). In this research paper, we propose an innovative approach to implement intelligent HVAC dispensing that improve venue experience and operational efficiencies through the application of Big Data Technologies, Edge processing and IoT Sensing. Our system combines a lightweight edge anomaly detection algorithm based on Kalman filter and venue ambient condition to foot traffic graph matrix. The amalgamation of anomaly detection using Kalman filter to the venue ambiance with the application of machine learning creates an adaptive edge and that is our formula to the innovation that we propose and present a prototyping solution design as well as its application and certain experimental results. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Robust object pose tracking plays an important role in robot manipulation, but it is still an open issue for quickly moving targets as motion blur and low frequency detection can reduce pose estimation accuracy even for state-of-the-art RGB-D-based methods. An event-camera is a low-latency vision sensor that can act complementary to RGB-D. Specifically, its sub-millisecond temporal resolution can be exploited to correct for pose estimation inaccuracies due to low frequency RGB-D based detection. To do so, we propose a dual Kalman filter: the first filter estimates an object's velocity from the spatiotemporal patterns of 'events', the second filter fuses the tracked object velocity with a low-frequency object pose estimated from a deep neural network using RGB-D data. The full system outputs high frequency, accurate object poses also for fast moving objects. The proposed method works towards low-power robotics by replacing high-cost GPU-based optical flow used in prior work with event-cameras that inherently extract the required signal without costly processing. The proposed algorithm achieves comparable or better performance when compared to two state-of-the-art 6-DoF object pose estimation algorithms and one hybrid event/RGB-D algorithm on benchmarks with simulated and real data. We discuss the benefits and tradeoffs for using the event-camera and contribute algorithm, code, and datasets to the community. The code and datasets are available at https://github.com/event-driven-robotics/Hybrid-object-tracking-with-events-and-frames. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The orthogonal signal generation (OSG) based single-phase phase-locked loops (PLLs) are probably the most popular and widely used single-phase PLLs within the areas of power electronic and power systems. The main difference among these PLLs lies in the OSG technique they use in their structure. The Kalman filter, second-order generalized integrator, all-pass filter (APF), transfer delay, Hilbert transform, and differentiator are well-known OSG techniques. Thanks to its ease of implementation, the APF is one of the most attractive OSG techniques. Despite its simplicity, using the APF has a serious drawback: the fictitious signal created by the APF is not orthogonal to the original single-phase signal when the grid frequency deviates from its nominal value. To deal with this problem, the frequency estimated by the PLL can be fed back to APF to make it frequency adaptive. Some stability concerns about adding such frequency feedback loop to the PLL structure, however, has reported in literature. Proposing two approaches to deal with this problem of APF based PLL is the main aim of this paper. © 2016 IEEE.},

The proposed methodology relies on the characterisation of a massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel with a quasi-deterministic radio channel generator and a cyclic prefix orthogonal frequency division multiplexing link-level radio simulation. The fifthgeneration (5G) new radio (NR) frame structure was used to perform channel estimation and equalisation for operation frequencies below 6 GHz. Numerical results show that the MRC receiver achieves its maximum performance with the KF estimator, especially at low signal-to-noise ratio scenarios, while the RZF receiver achieves its maximum performance with the LS estimation even in high interference scenarios. © 2020 Institution of Engineering and Technology.

	abstract = {The knowledge of snowpack dynamics is of critical importance to several real-time applications especially in mountain basins, such as agricultural production, water resource management, flood prevention, hydropower generation. Since simulations are affected by model biases and forcing data uncertainty, an increasing interest focuses on the assimilation of snow-related observations with the purpose of enhancing predictions on snowpack state. The study aims at investigating the effectiveness of snow multivariable data assimilation (DA) at an Alpine site. The system consists of a snow energy-balance model strengthened by a multivariable DA system. An Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) scheme allows assimilating ground-based and remotely sensed snow observations in order to improve the model simulations. This research aims to investigate and discuss: (1) the limitations and constraints in implementing a multivariate EnKF scheme in the framework of snow modelling, and (2) its performance in consistently updating the snowpack state. The performance of the multivariable DA is shown for the study case of Torgnon station (Aosta Valley, Italy) in the period June 2012 - December 2013. The results of several experiments are discussed with the aim of analyzing system sensitivity to the DA frequency, the ensemble size, and the impact of assimilating different observations. © 2018 Gaia Piazzi, et al., published by Sciendo 2018.},

	abstract = {Clinical applications that require extraction and interpretation of physiological signals or waveforms are susceptible to corruption by noise or artifacts. Real-time hemodynamic monitoring systems are important for clinicians to assess the hemodynamic stability of surgical or intensive care patients by interpreting hemodynamic parameters generated by an analysis of aortic blood pressure (ABP) waveform measurements. Since hemodynamic parameter estimation algorithms often detect events and features from measured ABP waveforms to generate hemodynamic parameters, noise and artifacts integrated into ABP waveforms can severely distort the interpretation of hemodynamic parameters by hemodynamic algorithms. In this article, we propose the use of the Kalman filter and the 4-element Windkessel model with static parameters, arterial compliance C, peripheral resistance R, aortic impedance r, and the inertia of blood L, to represent aortic circulation for generating accurate estimations of ABP waveforms through noise and artifact reduction. Results show the Kalman filter could very effectively eliminate noise and generate a good estimation from the noisy ABP waveform based on the past state history. The power spectrum of the measured ABP waveform and the synthesized ABP waveform shows two similar harmonic frequencies. © 2017 Frank Lam et al.},

	abstract = {To achieve comprehensive insulation deterioration motoring of power equipment and early fault warning in air-insulated substations, a data-driven partial discharge (PD) source localisation method employing noisy ultra-high frequency (UHF) received signal strength indicator (RSSI) and particle filter is proposed in this study. Compared with the existing UHF time-difference-based techniques, UHF wireless sensor arrays and RSSI-based methods provide an economical and high-adaptability solution. However, owing to the multi-pathing and shadowing effects, UHF signal attenuation cannot be modelled. Therefore, a Kalman filter was employed to smoothen the RSSI signal. Furthermore, a semi-parametric regression model is proposed to achieve a more accurate relationship between the RSSI and the transmission distance. Finally, in contrast to traditional localisation algorithms directly based on the RSSI ranging model, a particle filter was used to achieve higher accuracy. It predicted the best distribution of the position of PD by learning and considering all the system states of the previous moment. The laboratory test was performed within an area of 6 m × 6 m, and the results demonstrate that the mean PD source localisation error was 1.16 m, which gives a potential application for the identification of power equipment with insulation deterioration in a substation, while the accuracy is still needed to be verified further by field tests. © 2020 BMJ Publishing Group.

	abstract = {Smartphone receivers comprise approximately 1.5 billion global navigation satellite system receivers currently manufactured worldwide. Smartphone receivers provide measurements with lower signal levels and higher noise than commer-cial receivers. Because of constraints on size, weight, power consumption, and cost, it is challenging to achieve accurate positioning with these receivers, partic-ularly in urban environments. Traditionally, global positioning system measurements are processed via model-based approaches, such as weighted least-squares and Kalman filtering approaches. While model-based approaches can provide meter-level positioning accuracy in a postprocessing manner, these approaches require strong assumptions on the corresponding noise models and require manual tuning of parameters such as covariances. In contrast, learning-based approaches have been proposed that make fewer assumptions about the data structure and can accurately model environment-specific errors. However, these approaches provide lower accuracy than model-based methods and are sensitive to initialization. In this paper, we propose a hybrid framework for learning position correction, which corresponds to the offset between the true receiver position and the estimated position. For a learning-based approach, we propose a graph convolution neural network (GCNN) that can learn different graph struc-tures with multi-constellation and multi-frequency signals. For better initialization of the GCNN, we use a Kalman filter to estimate a coarse receiver position. We then use this coarse receiver position to condition the input features to the graph. We test our proposed approach on real-world data sets from the Google Smartphone Decimeter Challenge and show improved positioning performance over model-based methods such as the weighted least-squares and Kalman filter methods. © 2023 Institute of Navigation.},

Based on GPS data of “Crustal Movement Observation Network of China” (CMONOC), we extract ionospheric delay from leveled carrier phase observations and take VTEC of the grid points and DCB of receivers as parameters, then describe each state variable with random walk model, thus, setting up the regional ionospheric grid model using the Kalman filter estimation epoch by epoch, which gained good results. Taking global ionospheric maps (GIM) as reference, their variations characteristics of VTEC (vertical total electron content)were consistent. The inner precision of the model ranging from 1 to 3 TECU was detected, and the RMS were about 2.5 TEC and residuals were around 3 TECU. Besides, variations of receiver hardware delay within 2 TECU were relatively smooth. Compared with the regional stations’ receiver DCB isolated from the original observation using satellite DCB and spherical harmonic coefficients, the mean differences for a week were all within 2 ns. In addition, the results showed that less stations around grid leading to lower precision of VTEC because of shortage of the observations, and thus the greater the receiver DCB error was. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2016.},

Smart tags can communicate with existing RFID readers or interrogators while providing a battery-less platform for internal and external sensors to enrich available information about the environment and smart tag it. A reduced cost and size as well as an increased lifespan and durability of battery-free smart tags offer improvements in areas such as transportation and product tracking. Battery-free smart tags can ideally support arbitrarily complex sensor measurements, but in reality energy limitations can introduce great reductions in operating range and thus application range. In this work, we present an example application of a smart tag with a passive HF (high-frequency) RFID tag IC (integrated circuit) and MEMS (micro electro-mechanical structure) sensor. A standard HF RFID reader connected to a PC (personal computer) allowed the RF (radio frequency) field to power and communicate with the smart tag. A Kalman filter, implemented on a PC, was used to correct and improve the raw sensor data of smart tag orientation. Measurement results showed that the MEMS sensor on the smart tag could be powered for continuous operation and that raw smart tag orientation data could be read while in the RF field of a standard HF RFID reader, but at a limited range. © 2017 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Full-duplex transmission comprises the ability to transmit and receive at the same time on the same frequency band. It allows for more efficient utilization of spectral resources, but raises the challenge of strong self-interference (SI). Cancellation of SI is generally implemented as a multi-stage approach. This paper proposes a novel adaptive SI cancellation algorithm in the digital domain based on Kalman filter theory that creates the following advances: first, the number of unknowns of the nonlinear SI model in cascade structure is significantly reduced compared to the conventional Hammerstein parallel model since it decouples the identification of linear and nonlinear elements; second, the remote signal-of-interest (SoI) is explicitly considered in the algorithm since the Kalman filter approach tunes its adaptation by the SoI power or performs successive cancellation; third, temporal variations of the SI channel are covered by a composite state-space model. In our simulation results, we analyze the performance by evaluating residual interference, system identification accuracy, and communication rate. We show that our Kalman filter solution in cascade structure delivers good performance with low computational complexity. In this configuration, the performance lines up with that of the monolithic (parallel) Kalman filter or the recursive-least squares (RLS) algorithms with parallel Hammerstein models. We implement our algorithm as a component of a practical prototype that demonstrates the benefits of a slender algorithmic design like the proposed cascade structure. © 1991-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) aims to meet the needs of smart services by combining multiple information intelligence tools and network technologies. In terms of technology, management, cost, policy, and security, the development of the IoT still faces many challenges. This study proposes an intelligent image detection and transmission system based on IoT communication, with the following primary objectives: First, this study aims to provide an early warning model based on Kalman Filtering Fast Fourier Transform Support Vector Machine (KF-FFT-SVM). It delivers early warning signals by analyzing and extracting historical features from surface motion data for a given period. The step size for spectrum analysis is determined by the signal frequency and is used to create a training dataset and train the SVM model. The use of a trained model for early warning can improve the accuracy of early warning evaluation. Second, the forward line of the video image is used as the necessary information in the content symbol retrieval process, and the information required for the structure is used to improve the quality as much as possible. Because of the search and influence of the transmission quality of digital components, the important data in the digital transmission space is used to ensure the accuracy of digital components while transmitting a small amount of energy. Third, when the device is connected to the network, other users can obtain information about the device via security breaches. The data must be transmitted by both parties using their own identities, which increases transmission security. The design idea of ZigBee technology follows the method of distributing information, such as food space through a zigzag-shaped dance, and low power consumption with low cost. Finally, to increase system efficiency, non-orthogonal multiple access technologies realize and transmit data from multiple users in time, frequency, and code zones while using various channels for each user. The wireless signal-enabled environment is changed by varying the reflection coefficient of the passive reflector units, which are components of the same mapping set as the smart reflector. To improve the effectiveness and performance of the system transmission, the wireless signal may have the effect of boosting the signal or removing interference. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {The secret key rate of a continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) system is limited by excess noise. A key issue typical to all modern CV-QKD systems implemented with a reference or pilot signal and an independent local oscillator is controlling the excess noise generated from the frequency and phase noise accrued by the transmitter and receiver. Therefore accurate phase estimation and compensation, so-called carrier recovery, is a critical subsystem of CV-QKD. Here, we explore the implementation of a machine learning framework based on Bayesian inference, namely an unscented Kalman filter (UKF), for estimation of phase noise and compare it to a standard reference method and a previously demonstrated machine learning method. Experimental results obtained over a 20-km fibre-optic link indicate that the UKF can ensure very low excess noise even at low pilot powers. The measurements exhibited low variance and high stability in excess noise over a wide range of pilot signal to noise ratios. This may enable CV-QKD systems with low hardware implementation complexity which can seamlessly work on diverse transmission lines. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Wind energy is a fast-growing industry in Canada and worldwide. As wind turbine size and capacity increase, control systems become exceedingly important in order to maximize the efficiency of the power output and to reduce loads to extend their longevity. Effective wind speed (EWS) is not easy to measure because wind speed varies in time and space across the rotor area of the turbine, nor is it a real physical signal. This research aims to provide better knowledge of the input wind speed and to design a turbine controller based on this normally unknown input. First, nonlinear robust methods of state estimation were considered in order to deal with the nonlinearities present in the wind turbine model and the large exogenous disturbance of wind speed. Specifically the unscented H-infinity filter was used for robustness and accuracy. This unscented H-infinity scheme was then adopted in combination with a data fusion technique to estimate effective wind speed. This technique utilized high frequency data from the anemometer and treated the turbine as a sensor of low frequency data. These signals were fused to create an EWS estimate. The methods are thus shown to be effective in wind speed estimation for two sizes of turbines. © 2021 IEEE.},

For various amplitudes and frequencies of fault, it is not easy to obtain the accurate fault estimation using the model-based observers inherently possessing the accumulated errors and disturbance effect. Such model-based methods often result in undesired consequences; hence, this study employed the “model-free” ANN observer, without using any dynamics and parameters of a motor, to accomplish the better outcomes. Furthermore, the advantages of ANN observer for the fault estimation of the motor have been clearly investigated under several control/fault scenarios, and the effectiveness of proposed work has been validated through an actual experimental study. It is found that the performance of model-based approaches is degraded when the frequencies and amplitudes of fault and control scenarios are changed, but the ANN observer guaranteed performance that was almost the same regardless of fault and control scenarios. Notably, ANN observers showed 84% to 95% of estimation accuracy with almost no delay between estimates and actual faults while model-based approaches did 68% to 86% accuracy along with noticeable delay. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The grid voltage contains the positive sequence, negative sequence and harmonic component under the complex condition of voltage asymmetry, which can cause the great interference to the detection of synchronous sinusoidal signal of the power grid. Therefore, a detection method in a two-phase stationary reference frame is proposed based on extended kalman filter (EKF). Firstly, the Hilbert transform is combined with the Clark transform, and the positive sequence voltage signal is separated by eliminating the negative sequence component using the simple mathematical operation. Secondly, in order to extract the synchronous signal from the separate positive sequence signal, the positive sequence component in the two-phase stationary reference frame is used as the input signal of EKF. This method can not only estimate the positive sequence component of the fundamental wave, but also eliminate the Gaussian white noise of the system, which can more accurately solve the problem of actual working conditions. In this paper, EKF is used to estimate the amplitude and phase of grid voltage synchronization signal. The maximum error of voltage estimation is obviously reduced, compared with other optimized algorithms. Thus, EKF can better estimate the amplitude and phase of the grid voltage fundamental wave. Then, a closed-loop system is designed in this paper. Finally, the simulation and experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can extract grid sinusoidal signals under complex conditions accuracy, and have good frequency adaption characteristics. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) computation is a core task for the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem in autonomous mobile robots. The SLAM problem involves operations over high dimension data sets, requiring high throughput and performance, given the real-time nature of the robotics, control-decision algorithm this task is a part of. The lightweight and power restricted computing environments in mobile robotics requires customized processing systems such as Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). This work presents an arithmetic precision analysis and a Faddeev algorithm to calculate the Schur’s Complement hardware architecture implementation for the EKF-SLAM using a Systolic Array (SA). While it is widely believed that fixed-point implementations of arithmetic operations lead to area and performance benefits on FPGAs, the results in this article reveal that each Processing Element (PE) in the SA consumes 25% more logic and about 30% more register resources for the fixed-point 13.23 representation than if using the IEEE-754 single precision floating-point format. In addition, for FPGA devices with hardware support for key components of floating-point computations, a single PE floating-point implementation can achieve a maximum frequency up to 50% higher than a corresponding fixed-point implementation for the same relative numeric errors. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

	abstract = {Permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSM) are widely used in electric vehicle application due to their high power density, high efficiency and very good performance at low speeds. Safety concerns in automotive industry require monitoring of the system to ensure a correct and safe operation of the electric vehicle. This paper presents three software methods for estimating the winding electrical resistance and detecting an open phase failure during torque control operation of a PMSM. All three methods can be applied online. Differences between these methods are reflected into computational effort and efficiency. The described methods were numerically simulated and tested in MATLAB. The first two methods monitor the electrical resistance of the stator windings which are estimated through an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). Hence, the three phase model and the rotating reference frame model are both used as internal models for the proposed Kalman filters and the estimation performance is evaluated in each case. In order to detect an open phase fault, the gradient of the estimated electrical resistance is monitored. The third method which is independent of the motor parameters calculates the Discrete Fourier Transformation (DFT) coefficients of the fundamental frequency in the phase currents signals. Hence, due to the low computational effort and good performance, the Goertzel algorithm is proposed. Conclusions are drawn based on estimation accuracy, time response and complexity of each method. © 2014 IEEE.},

We found that the performance of the IMU degraded with time because of the accumulation of different errors. Using Allan variance analysis method, we identified the different components of noise present in the IMU, and verified the results by the power spectral density analysis (PSD). We tried to remove the high-frequency noise using smooth filters such as moving average filter and then Savitzky Golay (SG) filter. Even though we managed to filter some high-frequency noise, these filters performance wasn't satisfactory for our application. We found the distribution of the random noise present in IMU using probability density analysis and identified that the noise in our IMU was white Gaussian in nature.

	abstract = {Satellite communications are facing increasingly diverse physical and electromagnetic interference (EMI) that transmit radio frequency (RF) signals in X/Ku/K/Ka/Q-bands. Geolocation of the interfering source is an essential step in mitigating or eliminating the interference and restoring the operation of the communications service. RF emitter detection and localization is a key enabler for reliable space control, space situational awareness, intelligence surveillance, and reconnaissance, as well as satellite communications together with positioning, navigation, and timing. A key challenge is to obtain accurate 3-D space-based geolocation of ground-based EMI sources using a single satellite. Due to the limited power on a satellite and the usual clustering environments of EMI sources, passive geolocation is more feasible than active geolocation. This paper proposes a rapid and passive single-satellite-based 3D meter-level geolocation of ground EMI sources, which interfere with the uplinks of satellite communication (SATCOM) systems. In this paper, we focused on a rapid and passive Doppler based constrained unscented Kalman filters (cUKFs) for single-satellite-geolocation of ground EMI sources, which interfere with the uplinks of SATCOM systems. cUKF is a balanced choice between the geolocation performance and the computational costs. Specifically, we (i) design and implement Doppler and Doppler rate-based constrained unscented Kalman filters (cUKFs); (ii) design and implement a cross-correlation based blind Doppler estimation algorithms to compute the Doppler information from the received jamming signals without a priori information about the jamming waveforms; (iii) develop recursive constrained posterior Cramér-Rao bound (rcPCRB) for the nonlinear filtering problems; and (iv) conduct numerical simulations of these modules and demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed passive single satellite geolocation (SSG) solution on a practical scenario with one satellite and one ground-based EMI source. © 2023 Proceedings of the 36th International Technical Meeting of the Satellite Division of the Institute of Navigation, ION GNSS+ 2023.

	abstract = {The three-phase induction motor is well suited for a wide range of mobile drives, specifically for electric vehicle powertrain. During the entire life cycle of the electric motor, some types of failures can occur, with stator winding failure being the most common. The impact of this failure must be considered from the incipient as it can affect the performance of the motor, especially for electrically powered vehicle application. In this paper, the intern turn short circuit of the stator winding was studied using Fast Fourier transform (FFT) and Shor-Time Fourier transform (STFT) approaches. The residuals current between the estimated currents provided by the extended Kalman filter (EKF) and the actual ones are used for fault diagnosis and identification. Through FFT, the residual spectrum is sensitive to faults and gives the extraction of inter-turn short circuit (ITSC) related frequencies in the phase winding. In addition, the FFT is used to obtain information about when and where the ITSC appears in the phase winding. Indeed, the results allow to know the faulty phase, to estimate the fault rate and the fault occurrence frequency as well as their appearance time. © 2023 by the Authors.},

The actuator input and the measured position are used in an augmented nonlinear model to observe the dynamic states and parameters of the beam by the continuous-discrete extended Kalman filter (EKF). The presence of undesirable structural change is detected by variations of the first resonance estimate computed from the observed equivalent mass, stiffness, damping, and voltage-force conversion coefficients. A fault signal is generated upon its departure from a predetermined nominal tolerance band. The algorithm is implemented using automatically generated and deployed machine code on an electronics prototyping platform, featuring an economically feasible 8-bit microcontroller unit (MCU). The validation experiments demonstrate the viability of the proposed system to detect sudden or gradual mechanical changes in real-time, while the functionality on low-cost miniaturized hardware suggests a strong potential for mass-production and structural integration. The modest computing power of the microcontroller and automated code generation designates the proposed system only for very flexible structures, with a first dominant resonant frequency under 4 Hz; however, a code-optimized version certainly allows much stiffer structures or more complicated models on the same hardware. © 2015 Gergely Takács et al.},

For validation of a robust control algorithm, a shuttle tanker which has six thrusters is considered as dynamic positioned vessel.

It is also assumed that each thruster has limitation in generation of thrust in accordance with commercial thruster system. Conventional proportional and derivative (hereinafter PD) control algorithm is implemented for main feedback controller. A modified Integral (mod-I) controller is also applied in DP system to suppress steady state error. To allocate thrust, well known minimum power consumption algorithm based on Lagrange multiplier method is used. In the thrust allocation algorithm rudder effect in main propulsion system is considered. An extended Kalman filter (EKF) is used to separate low frequency (hereinafter LF) motion from total motion of the vessel. A set of experiment is designed and conducted to validate the present DP control algorithm.

	abstract = {To maximize the usage of limited transmission power and wireless spectrum, more communication satellites are adopting precise space-ground beam-forming, which poses a rigorous positioning and timing requirement of the satellite. To fulfill this requirement, a space-borne global navigation satellite system (GNSS) timing receiver with a disciplined high-performance clock is preferable. The space-borne GNSS timing receiver moves with the satellite, in contrast to its stationary counterpart on ground, making it tricky in its positioning algorithm design. Despite abundant existing positioning algorithms, there is a lack of dedicated work that systematically describes the delicate aspects of a space-borne GNSS timing receiver. Based on the experimental work of the LING QIAO (NORAD ID:40136) communication satellite‘s GNSS receiver, we propose a fine-tuned positioning algorithm for space-borne GNSS timing receivers. Specifically, the proposed algorithm includes: (1) a filtering architecture that separates the estimation of satellite position and velocity from other unknowns, which allows for a first estimation of satellite position and velocity incorporating any variation of orbit dynamics; (2) a two-threshold robust cubature Kalman filter to counteract the adverse influence of measurement outliers on positioning quality; (3) Reynolds averaging inspired clock and frequency error estimation. Hardware emulation test results show that the proposed algorithm has a performance with a 3D positioning RMS error of 1.2 m, 3D velocity RMS error of 0.02 m/s and a pulse per second (PPS) RMS error of 11.8ns. Simulations with MATLAB show that it can effectively detect and dispose outliers, and further on outperforms other algorithms in comparison. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {High-capacity impulse-radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) indoor localization systems are typically based on the time difference of arrival (TDoA) principle. When the fixed and synchronized localization infrastructure, the anchors, transmit precisely timestamped messages, a virtually unlimited number of user receivers (tags) are able to estimate their position based on differences in the time of arrival of those messages. However, the drift of the tag clock causes systematic errors at a sufficiently high magnitude to effectively deny the positioning, if left uncorrected. Previously, the extended Kalman filter (EKF) has been used to track and compensate for the clock drift. In this article, the utilization of a carrier frequency offset (CFO) measurement for suppressing the clock-drift related error in anchor-to-tag positioning is presented and compared to the filtered solution. The CFO is readily available in the coherent UWB transceivers, such as Decawave DW1000. It is inherently related to the clock drift, since both carrier and timestamping frequencies are derived from the identical reference oscillator. The experimental evaluation shows that the CFO-aided solution performs worse than the EKF-based solution in terms of accuracy. Nonetheless, with CFO-aiding it is possible to obtain a solution based on measurements from a single epoch, which is favorable especially for power-constrained applications. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Smartphone receivers comprise about 1.5 billion GNSS receivers currently manufactured in the world. Smartphone receivers provide measurements with lower signal levels and higher noise. Due to constraints on size, weight, power consumption, and cost, it is challenging to provide accurate positioning with these receivers, especially in urban environments. Traditionally, the GPS measurements are processed using model-based approaches, such as Weighted Least-Squares and Kalman filtering. While model-based approaches can provide meter-level positioning accuracy in a post-processing manner, they need strong assumptions on the noise models and require manual tuning of parameters such as covariances. In contrast, learning-based approaches have been proposed that make less assumptions about the data structure and can accurately model environment-specific errors. However, these approaches provide lower accuracy than model-based methods and are sensitive to initialization. In this paper, we propose a hybrid framework for learning position correction which is the offset between the true receiver position and the estimated position. For learning-based approach, we propose a Graph Convolution Neural Network (GCNN) that can learn different graph structures with multi-constellation and multi-frequency signals. For better initialization of the GCNN, we use a Kalman filter to estimate a coarse receiver position. We also use such a coarse receiver position to condition the input features to the graph. We test our proposed approach on the Google Smartphone Decimeter Challenge (GSDC) real-world datasets and show improved positioning performance over model-based methods such as Weighted Least-Squares and Kalman filter. © 2022 35th International Technical Meeting of the Satellite Division of the Institute of Navigation, ION GNSS+ 2022.

	abstract = {Scale formation is large deposits of minerals inside pipelines that obstructs fluid flow and causes serious operational and structural damage. Hidden inside the pipe, detection of its location presents a challenge and can be costly, tedious, and time consuming. In this work a new vibration-based method for scale formation (i.e. damage)detection in pipes is presented. The approach uses acceleration estimates, rather than actual measurements, to detect damage. Estimates are generated by a dynamic model constructed using two methods, namely (a)finite element, and (b)system identification. Acceleration estimates generated by the dynamic model are improved using Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG)servo-controller that requires minimal acceleration feedback from few accessible points on the pipeline. Power spectral densities of acceleration estimates (PSD's)of both, healthy and damaged pipe are compared to quantify shifts in resonant frequencies. Such shifts are treated as the primary indication of damage. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)of shifts was implemented to construct a statistical damage detection model that was able to identify the location of the scale formed within the pipeline. Experimental results have shown that the presented method is able to detect the scale location with good accuracy. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {System identification has been extensively studied to identify unknown parameters and excitations of a multi-degrees-of-freedom system. It is, however, found that if a single-degree-of-freedom (SDoF) system is under forced vibration and neither the system parameters nor the excitations are known, the identification is not possible with any existing system identification method. This paper solves this problem by assuming a stationary excitation with its energy smoothly varying close to the natural frequency of the system. An identification strategy is proposed for the SDoF system based on the Extended Kalman Filter with Unknown Input (EKF-UI) technique. Numerical example is presented to validate the proposed method on the excitation and system identification. This method is then applied to identify the aerodynamic force and system parameters of a high-rise building model in wind tunnel test. The vortex shedding induced excitation in the cross-wind direction can be clearly noted in the power spectrum of the identified wind load. © 2017 International Society for Structural Health  Monitoring of Intelligent Infrastrucure.

	abstract = {Brain machine interfaces (BMIs) used for movement restoration primarily rely on studies of motor decoding. It has been proved that local field potentials (LFPs) from primary motor cortex and premotor cortex of normal rodents could be used for decoding motor signals. However, few studies have explored the decoding performance of these brain areas under motor cortex damage. In this work, we focus on force decoding performance of LFPs spectrum from both ipsilesional caudal forelimb area (CFA) and rostral forelimb area (RFA) of rodents with ischemia over CFA. After three months of ischemia induced by photothrombosis over CFA, the power of high-frequency bands (>120 Hz) from both CFA and RFA can decode force signals by Kalman filters. The fair performance of CFA indicates motor reorganization over penumbra. Further exploration of RFA decoding ability proves that at least four electrodes of RFA should be used on decoding and electrodes far from CFA of stroke rats could achieve almost as good results as those close to CFA of normal rats, which indicates the motor remapping. Experimental results show the long-term stability of PM LFPs decoding performance of stroke rats as the trained Kalman model could be used to accurately decode force some days later which provides a possibility for online decoding system. In conclusion, our work shows that even under CFA ischemia, high-frequency power of LFPs from RFA is still able to accurately decode force signals and has long stability, which provides the possibility of BMIs for motor function reconstruction of chronic stroke patients. © 1964-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With the maturity of the CubeSat industry and advancements in commercial off-the-shelf components, CubeSat-based projects have become an attractive option for advanced outer space missions. This increase in mission complexity has given rise to the necessity of a new generation of accurate attitude determination subsystems. The purpose of this work, therefore, entails the design and development of an augmented stellar sensor. This sensor delivers accurate attitude and rate estimates at a fast update frequency, whilst conforming to the small satellite power and size requirements. The augmented systems use inertial rate sensor data, with error compensation performed by use of matched vector measurements obtained from a star sensor. Measurements are combined in an Extended Kalman filter, providing both high rate attitude propagation and bias drift compensation. The designed system features a robust tracking mode as well as a stellar gyro algorithm to deliver accurate low-rate rate estimates independent of host dynamics. To prove overall system functionality, the sensor has undergone verification testing in an in-house developed star emulation environment, as well as under night sky conditions. During these tests it was exposed to conditions typically experienced by satellites throughout their mission lifetimes. These conditions range from low-rate tumbling, to fine pointing. Initial testing shows that the system offers a robust response regardless of satellite rate and orientation whilst simultaneously adhering to CubeSat standards. Results show that the average 3Ïƒ rate accuracies were in the order of 0.01 â—¦/s whilst the 3Ïƒ orientation accuracy was close to 0.01â—¦ during low rates.

	abstract = {The gravity anomaly matching technique is one of the key technologies in gravity aided inertial navigation, which is a totally passive method to correct the accumulated system error. The gravity anomaly measurement with a gravimeter operates in the real position of a vehicle are compared with the data picked up from a gravity map with the position indicated by the inertial system. The difference contains the position error information which can be estimated in a kalman filter as well as in other system. In consideration of the nonlinearity of the gravity anomaly distribution, nonlinear filtering algorithms are applied into the gravity anomaly matching technique. The measurement noise which is the difference between the gravimeter data and the map data in the same position affect the estimating result a lot, while former studies usually use the white noise to simulate the measurement noise, which cannot represent the real situation. In this paper, the measurement noises are analyzed in detail based on the real gravimeter data and the existing gravity map. According to the applications of the shipborne inertial attitude measurement system, which moves in a relatively low speed, the characteristics of the measurement noises are discussed. Different from the former studies in which the measurement noises are simply treated as the white noise, the noise intensity and the correlation time are both considered as the parameters when modelling the measurement noise. The impact of the measurement noise on the gravity anomaly matching technique are also analyzed with different model parameters. Based on the parameter identification of the global gravity anomaly model, the frequency domain analysis are applied to the gravity anomaly signal that the shipborne inertial attitude measurement system sensed. The gravity anomaly signal along the trace are simulated as the Gauss-Markov process with different parameters, while the measurement noise are also generated independently. The impact of the measurement noise on the gravity anomaly matching technique are studied in detail with changing the parameter. Semi-physical simulations are operated with the real movement parameters of a shipborne inertial attitude measurement system and the simulated gravimeter data. With the cubature kalman filtering algorithm used in a single-axis rotation attitude heading measurement system, the matching results show that the attitude estimation accuracy and the convergence rate improves with the measurement noise intensity decreasing, which indicates that the measuring accuracy of the gravity anomaly data should be enhanced. On the other hand, with the correlation time increasing, the filter becomes much easier to diverge, which means the resolution power of the measuring data should be improved. Methods to decrease the time correlation of the gravity anomaly data are also discussed. Simulation results show that by extending the sample time or enhancing the space frequency, the diverging of the filter can both be well restrained. The optimal parameters are existed with given accuracy of the system and the movement. © 2019 Concern CSRI Elektropribor, JSC.},

	abstract = {The proposed work concentrates on the integration of an 8-GHz voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) and a frequency tripler for 24-GHz local oscillator generation. By stacking the VCO and the tripler with a current-reused topology, the power consumption of this integration can be saved. The proposed circuit with a total chip area of 0.7 mm ×0.8 mm is implemented in a 0.18 μm CMOS process. As the tuning voltage increases from 0 to 2 V, the measured frequency tuning range (FTR) of the VCO is from 7.06 to 8.33 GHz. The final resulting output frequency from the tripler ranges from 21.18 to 24.98 GHz (16.5% FTR). The core circuit totally consumes 5 mA from a 1.8-V supply voltage. The measured phase noises at the VCO and frequency tripler outputs are − 113.76 and − 105.1 dBc/Hz at 1-MHz offset frequency, respectively, when Vtune is 0 V. The best evaluated figure of merit with tuning is − 187.2 dBc/Hz (decibels relative to carrier). Closed form equations allow for a performance driven design for both PLL and estimator. By using a variable sample frequency controlled by the PLL, the Kalman filter is always operated around its center frequency, which is the rated grid frequency. The new topology is compared to other published single-phase PLL designs and its operation is verified by both simulations and experiments. This integration of a VCO and a frequency tripler exhibits a high potential for the use in low-power 24-GHz phase-locked loops. The PLL designed using dual mode logic technique exhibits excellent performance even under severely distorted utility grid voltage conditions. This robustness makes it very suitable for use in systems connected to grids having an important share of non-linear loads. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Recycled ICs have become a major threat to the ICs used in safety critical systems. In the current state-of-the-art techniques, recycled ICs are detected by measuring the frequency, current, path delay or power-up values to estimate the HCI, BTI and EM effects on the transistors with age. Some of the state-of-the-art techniques require additional on-chip sensors to detect and estimate the age of an IC while others use existing logic like SRAM and Flip-flops to detect the recycled ICs. In this paper, we provide a methodology to detect a recycled IC and also to estimate its age by using the existing IO pad structures. For the first time, age is estimated by measuring voltage drop across the protection diodes present in IO pad structure. With this methodology, no additional sensors have to be added and hence there is no area overhead. With this proposed methodology, ICs that are used for a minimum period of a day can be effectively detected by using the concept of extended Kalman filtering technique for the first time in this domain. By stressing the part for five days, our proposed methodology can estimate the age of the IC aged between 1 month to 5 years with 95% percent of accuracy. © 2021 IEEE},

Usually, a grid of Micro-Processors-Units or Micro-Controller-Units (MCUs) is employed to solve this problem, given the ease of programming. However, this solution can carry some drawbacks like the necessity of more space for computer resources. This work introduces a System-on-Chip based approach that carries out the control of a robotic hand with multiple Degree of Freedom. In order to justify its advantages, the proposed solution was tested in a robotic hand and compared against other implementations on (a) an ATMEL microcontroller, (b) an ARM processor, and (c) a full-dedicated hardware architecture on FPGA. Comparisons were made in terms of performance, computational resources, and power consumption. Additionally, our results showed an improvement over a previous MCU-Grid-based hand controller that achieved a control loop frequency of 1 KHz. In contrast, the proposed SoC approach achieved a 47.26 kHz frequency, showing the advantages of using our parameterizable floating-point arithmetic cores, which allow the designer to adjust the word-width to optimize both the hardware resources and energy consumption. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Low-cost GNSS receivers, such as U-Blox, have become a mass-market device used by millions of people every day. Current positioning accuracy of few meters with these devices is not precise enough for applications such as intelligent transportation systems, precise agriculture and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) guidance, which requiring sub-meter to centimeter level accuracy. RealTime Kinematics (RTK) is a differential method that can steady offer centimeter level solutions in real time if a dual-frequency geodetic GNSS receiver and a physical or virtual base station are available. However, such geodetic-grade receivers are currently too expensive to gain popularity in the mass market. In this paper, we proposed a single-frequency GPS/BDS RTK algorithm using raw carrier phase, pseudorange and Doppler observations from a low-cost GNSS receiver. As we all know, this kind of receiver is usually designed for mass-market applications, so constraints in power consumption and costs are very stringent and then result in lower-quality measurements compared to high-precision receiver. There are two main challenges that code measurements suffer from serious multipath error and carrier phase measurements frequently loss of lock. To cope with these problems, a new outlier and cycle slip detection strategy is developed and a new robust Kalman filter is implemented. The RTK implementation presented in this paper utilizes the Hi-Target Continuously Operating Reference Stations Network (HT-CORS) as the base station, both in single-base and network RTK mode. For comparison purpose, a geodetic-grade dual-frequency receiver is also used to provide a reference position solution in different testing scenarios. The test results show that a horizontal position accuracy of better than 0.5 meters can be achieved for more than 99% of the time using a U-Blox M8T receiver with a small helix antenna in kinematic mode. Both single-baseline and network RTK experiment show comparable positioning performance. Obtaining sub-meter accuracy with such a low-cost device expected to be useful in various precise applications, such as intelligent transportation systems and geographic information system. Furthermore, we investigated the possibility of ambiguity resolution (AR) with this low-cost receiver in a postprocessing test. Instead of a helix antenna, we use an external high precise antenna (∼150$) to guarantee that code measurements are good enough to provide carrier phase ambiguity datum. A Trimble BD970 dual-frequency GNSS receiver, which is one of the stations of HT-CORS, is selected as the single-base station. Both static and kinematic observations are collected within a short-baseline (<10km) with time span of 4 hours and half an hour, respectively. A new partial ambiguity resolution (PAR) algorithm is adopted, which is of great benefit when full ambiguity resolution fails under challenging conditions. The results are encouraging that a positioning accuracy of 1.2cm (2D RMS) is achievable in static mode, with an ambiguity fixing rate greater than 98%. For kinematic test, the ambiguity fixing rate is about 90% and a positioning accuracy of 2.4cm (2D RMS) is also achievable. The results indicate that using a consumer-grade receiver can obtain comparable accuracy instead of using an expensive geodetic-grade receiver, making it a promising technique in various high precise applications, especially in the field of UAV guidance.},

For early alerting of SSO and effective development of protection and control strategies, it is critical to monitor and identify SSO accurately and quickly. Ambient data is continuously available, which is useful for online monitoring. This paper proposes an ambient data-driven SSO online monitoring method based on the Kalman filter (KF) combined with the multi-model partitioning filter (MMPF). The KF is utilized to fit the measured ambient data with an auto regressive (AR) model. Then, the damping factor (or damping ratio) and frequency in the SSO mode can be acquired by solving the roots of the characteristic polynomial corresponding to the AR model. Moreover, the MMPF is an effective model order selection method applied to the KF for better identification. The performance of the MMPF-KF method is demonstrated by simulations and real-time experiments. The results of case studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed method under various conditions. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.},

No additional sensors are used for inner loop variables. These are estimated using a Kalman filter, based on a linearized converter model. The advantage of this sensorless scheme is not only reducing the number of sensors but more significantly providing an alternative to sensing high frequency resonant tank variables which require high microcontroller resolution in real time. First, the converter non-linear large signal behavior is linearized using a state feedback based scheme. Consequently, the converter preserves its large signal characteristics while modeled as a linear system. Comparison is made between the most suitable state variables for feedback, according to a stability study.

	abstract = {Advances in the development of micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) have made possible the fabrication of cheap and small dimension accelerometers and gyroscopes, which are being used in many applications where the global positioning system (GPS) and the inertial navigation system (INS) integration is carried out, i.e., identifying track defects, terrestrial and pedestrian navigation, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), stabilization of many platforms, etc. Although these MEMS sensors are low-cost, they present different errors, which degrade the accuracy of the navigation systems in a short period of time. Therefore, a suitable modeling of these errors is necessary in order to minimize them and, consequently, improve the system performance. In this work, the most used techniques currently to analyze the stochastic errors that affect these sensors are shown and compared: we examine in detail the autocorrelation, the Allan variance (AV) and the power spectral density (PSD) techniques. Subsequently, an analysis and modeling of the inertial sensors, which combines autoregressive (AR) filters and wavelet de-noising, is also achieved. Since a low-cost INS (MEMS grade) presents error sources with short-term (high-frequency) and long-term (low-frequency) components, we introduce a method that compensates for these error terms by doing a complete analysis of Allan variance, wavelet de-nosing and the selection of the level of decomposition for a suitable combination between these techniques. Eventually, in order to assess the stochastic models obtained with these techniques, the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) of a loosely-coupled GPS/INS integration strategy is augmented with different states. Results show a comparison between the proposed method and the traditional sensor error models under GPS signal blockages using real data collected in urban roadways. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {JZS oilfield is an offshore metamorphic rock fractured buried hill oilfield. It was put into development in July 2010. The overall production situation of the oilfield is good, but some problems have been exposed. The main performance is as follows: It is difficult to accurately characterize the heterogeneity of fracture space distribution; In the numerical simulation of fractured reservoir, it is impossible to accurately describe and predict the fracture flow of fluid channeling in corner point grid system. In order to solve the above problems, this study presents a new integrated fractured reservoir geological modeling and numerical simulation research method based on unstructured grid. There are three key aspects to this method. (1) The multi-scale (large, middle and small) discrete fracture system is established by combining outcrop measurement data with well point information and seismic attributes. On the basis of post-stack 3D seismic data, ants attributes are extracted, then the ant body results are transformed into large scale fractures; Using azimuth anisotropy attribute based on pre-stack inversion and combining the distribution orientation of large-scale fractures, the middle-scale fractures are established; According to the power law distribution relation between the cumulative frequency and the fracture length of large scale and small scale which based on outcrop observation, the imaging logging data and pre-stack inversion azimuth anisotropy attribute, small scale fractures are constructed by DFN technology.(2) For multi-scale fractures, the unstructured grid division technique is used to build a 3D model that conforms to the heterogeneity of dual media. In this study, a layered triangular prism grid generation technique is proposed. It is used to establish model of multi-scale fractures based on unstructured grid. Using large-scale fractures as a constraint, full 3D unstructured grid model is set up, and the discrete fracture model can accurately describe the fracture system and the coupling relationship between matrix and the fracture;(3)The triple-medium numerical simulation of the reservoir in the study area is carried out by using the automatic history fitting technology of ensemble kalman filter (EnKF). After several parameter adjustments, both the coincidence rate of the index and the fitting precision are higher than before. Multi-scale discrete fracture model based on the large-scale fractures discretization processing, equivalent medium processing to middle and small scale fractures, keeps the seepage characteristic of the large-scale discrete fractures model and ensures the calculation efficiency. The results show that the new method has obvious advantages in computing speed and that the fitting effect is closer to the actual production performance. © 2019, International Petroleum Technology Conference},

	abstract = {It is well recognized that a wind turbine has a large radar cross-section (RCS) and, due to the movement of the blades, the wind turbine will generate a Doppler frequency shift. This scattering behavior may cause severe interferences on existing radar systems including static ground-based radars and spaceborne or airborne radars. To resolve this problem, efficient techniques or algorithms should be developed to mitigate the effects of wind farms on radars. Herein, one transponder-based mitigation technique is presented. The transponder is not a new concept, which has been proposed for calibrating high-resolution imaging radars. It modulates the radar signal in a manner that the retransmitted signals can be separated from the scene echoes. As wind farms often occupy only a small area, mitigation processing in the whole radar operation will be redundant and cost inefficient. Hence, this paper uses a transponder to determine whether the radar is impacted by the wind farms. If so, the effects of wind farms are then mitigated with subsequent Kalman filtering or plot target extraction algorithms. Taking airborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and pulse Doppler radar as the examples, this paper provides the corresponding system configuration and processing algorithms. The effectiveness of the mitigation technique is validated by numerical simulation results. © 2013 Wen-Qin Wang.},

	abstract = {This paper concerns state estimation problems in a mean field control setting. In a finite population model, the goal is to estimate the joint distribution of the population state and the state of a typical individual. The observation equations are a noisy measurement of the population. The general results are applied to demand dispatch for regulation of the power grid, based on randomized local control algorithms. In prior work by the authors it is shown that local control can be designed so that the aggregate of loads behaves as a controllable resource, with accuracy matching or exceeding traditional sources of frequency regulation. The operational cost is nearly zero in many cases. The information exchange between grid and load is minimal, but it is assumed in the overall control architecture that the aggregate power consumption of loads is available to the grid operator. It is shown that the Kalman filter can be constructed to reduce these communication requirements, and to provide the grid operator with accurate estimates of the mean and variance of quality of service (QoS) for an individual load. © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {One of the basic tasks for autonomous flight with aerial vehicles (drones) is the detection of obstacles within its flight environment. As the technology develops and becomes more robust, drones will become part of the toolkit to aid maintenance repair and operation (MRO) and ground personnel at airports. Currently laser technology is the primary means for obstacle detection as it provides high resolution and long range. The high intensity laser beam can result in temporary blindness for pilots when the beam targets the windscreen of aircraft on the ground or on final approach within the vicinity of the airport. An alternative is ultrasonic sensor technology, but this suffers from poor angular resolution. In this paper we present a solution using time-of-flight (TOF) data from ultrasonic sensors. This system uses a single commercial 40 kHz combined transmitter/ receiver which returns the distance to the nearest obstacle in its field of view, +/- 30 degrees given the speed of sound in air at ambient temperature. Two sonar receivers located either side of the transmitter / receiver are mounted on a horizontal rotating shaft. Rotation of this shaft allows for separate sonar observations at regular intervals which cover the field of view of the transmitter / receiver. To reduce the sampling frequency an envelope detector is used prior to the analogue-digital-conversion for each of the sonar channels. A scalar Kalman filter for each channel reduces the effects of signal noise by providing real time filtering (Drongelen, 2017a). Four signal metrics are used to determine the location of the obstacle in the sensors field of view: 1. Maximum (Peak) frequency 2. Cross correlation of raw data and PSD 3. Power Spectral Density 4. Energy Spectral Density Results obtained in an actual indoor environment are presented to support the validity of the proposed algorithm. © 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Time synchronization is a crucial service task in a distributed network. Although several works are reported in routing and medium access control of mobile wireless sensor networks (MWSNs), or for navigation in a collaborative swarm of robots, prior time synchronization is stated as one of the prior requirement. In this paper, we study the problem of time synchronization over a wireless network for a swarm robotic system. We propose a fully decentralized, energy efficient framework for global synchronization of swarm of robots. The major contribution of this work is in terms of proposing a scalable, topology independent, mobility-assisted time synchronization framework with resynchronization interval in the order of several minutes (tested up to 10 min) which we believe will accelerate development of swarm robotic systems and mobile wireless sensor networks for several human-friendly real-world applications. The proposed framework which implements time synchronization in two phases, (1) One-way time offset compensation and (2) Relative skew fingerprinting based frequency offset compensation, is flexible and can be tuned easily to suit several application scenarios. Another unique characteristic of the framework is that it utilizes only one-way messages for the time offset and frequency offset compensation. We also demonstrate that the protocol scales very well for multi-hop scenarios and that bounded synchronization error across the network can be achieved using the framework. Analysis on the suitability of our framework for dynamic environments is also presented. We also present a fair comparative analysis of our work with the predictive protocols based on techniques such as Linear regression, Linear prediction and Kalman filter and consensus based synchronization proposed for static networks. The results and analysis presented here are derived from the analytical and empirical study on mobile nodes/robots spread over a duration of 5 months. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

It is well known that the speed of induction motors is unobservable at very low stator frequencies. This paper uses an observability index to continuously analyze speed observability for sensorless control of induction machines. The correlation between observability-index and observer performance is illustrated in a Hardware in the Loop (HIL) experimental test-bench combining the well-known vector control with an extended Kalman filter. Thanks to the observability-index information, an optimal strategy is proposed to design controllers to guide the system away from undesirable behavior and avoid the weak observability-index region by taking into account all working constraints. A simplified case is presented to improve the speed observer performance, which was tested in the same conditions with the same HIL test-bench to experimentally validate the proposed sensorless control for traction applications. © 2017},

	abstract = {With the growth of air transport, the air traffic control needs to enforce the Communication navigation surveillance air traffic management (CNS-ATM) because this is the back bone of the air operation in any country. This system has the responsibility of guaranteeing air safety and management of the national air space (NAS) that nowadays needs to increase the flight density to respond to the demand. To accomplish this, new technologies like air dependent surveillance broadcast (ADS-B) have been used to increase the accuracy and time response of data air surveillance sensor integration of sensor location and the reliability of ATM system. CNS-ATM system for surveillance and control of aircrafts have been mainly used in primary and secondary radars to calculate the aircraft position through signal delay or time difference between transponder pulses. The accuracy of each sensor depends on internal and external factors such as frequency, power, target distance, noise, maintenance, and others. When an aerodyne is detected by multiple sensors, it could create a multiple track in a geographic and temporal space where the aircraft will be possibly flying. This space depends of radar update time, aerodyne speed, and the accuracy of each sensor, and it is difficult to know where the aircraft really is. This work proposes a technique based on ADS-B for making an error calculation of each sensor in a fusion system, using business intelligence techniques for understanding the error condition of each sensor in a geographical area. Based on results, we propose a technique that could make an error correction to avoid phase shifts between sensors. The information of this data study was used for statistical calculation values such as variance and standard deviation. For fusion accuracy improvement, three steps have been proposed in this research. First, the use of the radar error by region and statistical values by calculating the Kalman filters for each sensor to reduce the internal error of the radar. Second, the bias measured against ADS-B signal, used like a parameter to calculate radar bias correction that could be applied as a feedback input in a homogenization signal process or tracking process to reduce sensor bias in a recurrent process. Third, the use of Kalman prediction characteristic to replace missing points in a trajectory calculation. This technique was implemented by Colombian system to reduce error and bias sensor and a user's quality perception in a radar tracking and fusion track system in a surveillance network. In this process, it was found that it is possible to use it by a repetitive error measured ADS-B track like a reference track to calculate the error and in this way, it could be possible to reduce the uncertainty about the aircraft position. On the other hand, the use of data analysis process based on business intelligent tools allows us to easier understand the radar error behavior. Both methodology and results will be described here. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Tire pressure state is crucial for driving performance and fuel efficiency and is the welfare of the driver. Tire inflation pressure greatly affects fuel consumption, driving dynamics and the tire lifespan. Hence, the state of tire pressure must be continuously sensed for comfort riding, optimal vehicle handling, and safety, and it is necessary for all types of transport. The existing detection methods are high cost and without any redundancy, if the sensor gets fails, which retard its wide application. The support vector machine (SVM) learning method is introduced for tire pressure loss detection. But, this method is not so accurate in detecting the normal and pressure loss judgement of tires. This research presents a novel approach for a tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS) to reduce the cost of sensor-based frames. The proposed model comes under three stages: pre-processing, feature extraction and tier pressure detection. Initially, an adaptive and unbiased Kalman filter (KF) with a recursive least square (RLS) algorithm (AUK-RLS) approach is introduced to eliminate manufacturing errors in speed gear. The second stage is the extraction of features. Statistical, frequency domain, and fitted frequency domain characteristics features are extracted from the wheel speed signal in this stage. It is fed to the deep learning (DL) model to perform the judgement of tier state. While using floating point model for the operation and storage process, the hardware cost of the DL model tends to be high. To tackle this issue, the convolutional neural network (CNN) hardware design will be optimized by combining both Integer/Floating-Point type inference engines. The design modules of the CNN interference engine are insisted of buffers, on-chip/off-chip memories, controllers, fine state machine (FSM), processing engine (PE) and routers. The PE module needs several adders and multiplier units, and this performs the convolution operation. Therefore, to diminish the area, delay and power consumption, the modified adder and multiplier design named Vedic multiplier based Carry select adder with simplified combinational logics (CSLA-SCL) is emphasized. The proposed system is implemented using Verilog code synthesis in the Xilinx ISE 14.5 simulator platform. The performance measure of pressure loss detection in terms of accuracy (99.25%) and errors are examined. Also, the performance measure of the detection model with the proposed adder and multiplier design is examined in terms of area utilization, power (145 mW), frequency (756 MHz) and delay (7.12 ns). © 2023},

	abstract = {Small satellites have become capable platforms for a wide range of commercial, scientific and defense missions. Improved onboard clocks would make small satellites a viable option for even more missions, enabling radio aperture interferometry with small satellite constellations, improved radio occultation measurements of scintillating signals, high altitude GPS navigation, and GPS augmentation. Chip Scale Atomic Clocks (CSACs), introduced in 2011, provide exceptional long term time stability for a relatively low cost with minimal size, weight, and power (SWAP), and have been space qualified [1, 2]. However, CSACs also have relatively poor stability for time frames less than 100 seconds, and higher phase noise than less expensive crystal oscillators. Additionally, CSACs alone do not provide sufficient long-term stability for some missions without external synchronization. This paper investigates methods to improve small satellite timekeeping by combining a heterogeneous group of oscillators including multiple CSACs, a GPS receiver, a crystal oscillator, and time error measurement using ground stations. Two methods for combining clocks are studied: Phase Locked Loops (PLLs), and Kalman filters. The performance of the two methods is compared for LEO missions with and without a GPS reference. The goal is to provide an onboard reference clock with excellent long and short-term stability and low SWAP. The results provide insight into the practical limitations expected when implementing an advanced clock system on very small satellites, and include the effects of clock offset measurement resolution and frequency errors due to temperature variation over the orbit. It was found that a combination of a Kalman filter and a PLL provides the best overall performance when using an external GPS receiver. Simulations of this combination demonstrate a reference clock with RMS time errors of approximately half a nanosecond, and estimated power less than one Watt. The simulations also show the importance of the time offset measurement resolution. © 2019 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper describes an efficient method for scheduling an energy-consuming sensor sparingly in combination with an on-off controller, specifically for a finite horizon control problem in which only end states are critical. In certain low-power applications, such as autonomous microrobotics, on-off controllers can be very efficient in operating piezoelectric actuators (and other capacitive actuation schemes) compared to traditional analog and pulsewidth modulation controllers. However, with existing sensing circuitry, sensing at the same frequency as control can be prohibitively expensive, because energy consumption in the sensing circuitry may be comparable or even much higher than energy consumption for actuation. Instead, a method is presented for best scheduling a limited number of sensor measurements and updates to control inputs during a finite horizon on-off control problem, in response to Gaussian disturbances and measurement noise. To simplify the problem, a lower bound for the expected value of a quadratic error function of the end states is found, which permits rapid evaluation of candidate sensor times. When actuator energy consumption is incorporated in the optimization, this produces a numerically efficient near-optimal strategy for determining best measurement times and updates to the control input sequence. © 1996-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This study proposes a model that forecasts visibility in winter on the basis of a CCTV-Camera-Based Road Visibility Information System (RVIS) that was developed by the authors to minimize winter hazards, including traffic accidents resulting from snowstorm-induced poor visibility. The RVIS quantifies road images recorded by multiple closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras along the roads to automatically apply the quantified information to pre-defined visibility indexes that indicate levels of road visibility. To quantify the road images, the weighed intensity of power spectrum (WIPS) is calculated such that its magnitude represents the difference in spatial frequencies. When road visibility decreases from snowstorm or fog, the contrast of road view contained in the CCTV camera image decreases. From WIPS values, the road visibility index (RVI) is calculated. The RVI is categorized into 4 ranks for greater understandability by users: Level 1 (<342><211><247>500 m), Level 2 (200~500 m), Level 3 (100~200 m) and Level 4(<100 m). From the RVI ranks, road users can know the visibility level on the route where they are planning to drive. The objective of this study is to develop a visibility forecast model utilizing the RVIS. To achieve the goal, we used the data of the WIPS values and RVI ranks recorded by the RVIS, as well as 1-km-mesh meteorological data recorded by the Japan Weather Association. A feasibility study on the visibility forecast model was conducted during the winter of 2009-2010 at a 35-km section of National Route 40 in Hokkaido, Japan. In the study, 1-km-mesh meteorological data were used to estimate the WIPS values and RVI ranks a few hours ahead of time by employing a multiple-regression model and the Kalman filter. The relationship between WIPS data from road images as dependent variables and the meteorological data as independent variables was examined to compare the accuracy of WIPS estimation between the two models. As a result, the correlation coefficient for the Kalman filter indicated better fit than that for the multiple-regression model. Thereby, the Kalman filter was identified to be more applicable than the multiple-regression approach to create a road visibility forecast model. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

	abstract = {The autonomous real-time optical navigation of planetary unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is of the key technologies to ensure the success of the exploration. In such a GPS-denied environment, vision-based localization is an optimal approach. In this article, we proposed a terrain aided simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) algorithm, which simultaneously reconstructs the 3-D map point of environment and estimates the location of a planet UAV based on preexisting digital elevation model (DEM). To directly georeference the onboard UAV images to the digital terrain model, a theoretical model is proposed to prove that topographic features of UAV image and DEM can be correlated in the frequency domain via cross power spectrum. To provide the six-DOF of the UAV, we developed an optimization approach, which fuses the geo-referencing result into an SLAM system via local bundle adjustment (LBA) to achieve robust and accurate vision-based navigation even in featureless planetary areas. To test the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed localization algorithm, a new dataset for planetary drone navigation is proposed based on simulation engine. The proposed dataset includes 40 200 synthetic drone images taken from nine planetary scenes with related DEM query images. Comparison experiments are carried out to demonstrate that over the flight distance of 33.8 km, the proposed method achieved an average localization error of 0.45 m, compared to 1.32 m by ORB-SLAM2 and 0.75 m by ORB-SLAM3, with the processing speed of 12 Hz, which will ensure real-time performance. We will make our datasets available to encourage further work on this topic.  © 1980-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Enhanced recover)' methods have become significant in the industry's drive to increase recovery rates from oil and gas reservoirs. For heavy oil reservoirs, the immobility of the oil at reservoir temperatures, causcd by its high viscosity, limits the recovery rates and strains the economic viability of these fields. While thermal recovery methods, such as steam injection or THAI, have extensively been applied in the field, their success has so far been limited due to prohibitive heat losses and the difficulty in controlling the combustion process. Electromagnetic (EM) heating via high-frequency EM radiation has attracted attention due to its wide applicability in different environments, its efficiency, and the improved controllability of the heating process. While becoming a promising technology for heavy oil recovery, its effect on overall reservoir production and fluid displacements are poorly understood. Reservoir history matching has become a vital tool for the oil & gas industry to increase recovery rates. Limited research has been undertaken so far to capture the nonlinear reservoir dynamics and significantly varying flow rates for thermally heated heavy oil reservoir that may notably change production rates and render conventional history matching frameworks more challenging. We present a new history matching framework for EM heated heavy oil reservoirs incorporating cross-well seismic imaging. Interfacing an EM heating solver to a reservoir simulator via Andrade's equation, we couple the system to an ensemble Kalman filter based history matching framework incorporating a cross-well seismic survey module. With increasing power levels and heating applied to the heavy oil reservoirs, reservoir dynamics change considerably and may lead to widely differing production forecasts and increased uncertainty. We have shown that the incorporation of seismic observations into the EnKF framework can significantly enhance reservoir simulations, decrease forecasting uncertainties and cope with the growing nonlinearity caused by the heating process for efficient and accurate reservoir forecasting.

	abstract = {In this paper, a discrete-time model predictive controller using Laguerre orthonormal function-based (LMPC) for active flutter suppression of a two-dimensional wing with a flap is presented. In this work, a linear mathematical state-space model for the pitch, plunge, and flap degrees of freedom under unsteady aerodynamics is derived and used to determine the linear flutter velocity and frequency of the parameters of a selected experimental wing. To verify the model, the open-loop simulation results are compared to an experimental study using the same wing from the literature. The state-space system is then discretized and LMPC with a Kalman filter is designed and tuned using the MATLAB® simulation environment at a selected speed in the linear flutter region. The predictive control advantage of dealing with input constraints in a systematic manner is explored through a quantitative analysis of the response of both constrained and unconstrained LMPC controllers. The results indicate that theoretically both cases can give excellent performance. However, the input trajectory generated by the unconstrained LMPC is very aggressive in a way that it is considered impractical when compared to the physical limits of an experimental actuator from the literature. The potential of LMPC to achieve a reasonable performance at a significantly lower computational cost compared to the classical model predictive controller (MPC) is investigated by measuring the time required by the same computer to compute the control trajectory for both controllers. The data suggest that LMPC requires remarkably low computational power, which makes it an excellent choice for fast aeroelastic applications. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In SDN-based WLAN, controller needs to collect the state info of Mobile Nodes (MNs) like received signal strength indicator (RSSI) for handoff. In such scenarios, high sampling rate facilitates handoff, but it also easily leads to system overhead thus limits access scale of MN. Besides, dynamical adjustment of transmit power of access point (AP) leads to the distinctive signal coverage. Existing handoff algorithms that directly use the uplink RSSI as handoff condition would result in significant throughput decay of MN. Also in indoor deployment RSSI may varies much, large variation of RSSI result in unstable handoff. To address the issues, we design a variable sampling rate mechanism, then filter sampling RSSI and propose a handoff algorithm for distinctive signal coverage scenarios. Our sampling mechanism uses a finite state machine (FSM) to adjust the sampling rate by MN on all nearby APs. Our handoff algorithm uses Kalman filter to achieve stable and trend-reflecting uplink RSSI estimation, then estimate downlink signal noise ratio (SNR) difference between potential and current AP. We implement our algorithm and deployed a test-bed for extensive experiments.

	abstract = {The damage degree of pot seedling in the process of automatic transplanting in dry farming has a direct impact on the survival rate of pot seedling in the later stage. Moreover, the clamping force of pot seedling plays key role in evaluating the damage degree. Aiming at the problems of narrow installation space, improper arrangement of testing equipment to damage seedling or bring back seedling matrix in the automatic transplanter with adjustable clamping force, a clamping force detection system of pot seedling was developed based on piezoelectric film (Polyvinylidene fluoride, PVDF) and signal conditioning technology. The system consisted of PVDF piezoelectric film, special signal conditioning circuit, wireless communication module and signal acquisition software system. The working procedure of the system can be divided into the following steps. Firstly, PVDF piezoelectric film monitored the change of clamping force of seedling claw on pot seedling in real time, and the clamping force was converted into electric charge by piezoelectric effect. Secondly, via the special signal conditioning circuit, the system can implement charge-voltage signal conversion, signal amplification, signal elimination of power frequency, and weaken the vibration and noise generated by ground excitation and transplanter operation. Thirdly, the processed clamping force signal was sent to the signal acquisition software system based on LabVIEW by wireless communication module, and the residual vibration noise was filtered through Kalman filter. The whole system can effectively realize the measurement, indication, storage and warning the clamping force of pot seedling, and assist to reduce the damage rate of pot seedling and improve the success rate of transplantation. In addition, the calibration experiments and laboratory validation experiments were performed to verify the precision and reliability of the system respectively. The calibration experiments demonstrated that the average linear determination coefficient of the clamping force detection sensor was 0.991 4, the average sensitivity was 1.002 7, and the accuracy was 6.024%. The laboratory validation experiments indicated that the mean and maximum fluctuation ranges of the clamping force measurement values were small, and the standard deviation of the clamping force measurement values of each group were lower than 0.076 N, and the output voltage value of the clamping force detection sensor was basically consistent with the variation law of the clamping force during the actual transplanting process. In conclusion, the overall results showed that the developed system had the advantages of high measurement accuracy, low cost and fast response, and can provide a useful reference for clamping force detection of pot seedling in automatic transplanter. © 2019, Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery.

	abstract = {In recent years, the electric vehicle wireless charging system (EV-WCS) has been widely concerned because it is safe, reliable, automatic, and environment-friendly. The high-frequency and high-power electromagnetic field between the transmitting coil and receiving coil of an EV-WCS may be harmful to an intruded living object. Therefore, a reliable and sensitive living object detection device has to be equipped to reduce or close the charging power as living objects entering the wireless charging region. Existing studies mainly focused on the presence/absence detection of living objects, but lacked research on multiple object detection and moving trajectory track, which are both benefit for practical applications. This paper develops a 77GHz millimeter-wave radar-based moving foreign object detection method based on Kalman filter and data association algorithms. Simulation and experiments are both implemented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Firstly, principle of the frequency modulated continuous wave radar is introduced. Formulations for calculating distance, velocity, and angle, are deduced. Secondly, a method that combines a Kalman filter with target clustering and data association algorithms is developed to track the moving trajectories of multiple objects. In particular, the Kalman filter is employed to reduce the influence of measurement noises. The DBSCAN algorithm is used for target clustering. The joint probabilistic data association algorithm is utilized to track multiple object trajectories. Finally, the proposed method is evaluated with simulation and experiments on TI IWR1642 77GHz radar in terms of measurement accuracy and multiple objects track. The results show that the proposed method can simultaneously measure the distance, velocity, angle, and number of moving objects with an average distance error of 2cm. Particularly, it can distinguish multiple objects that are very close to each other. With the DBSCAN algorithm, the proposed method can cluster five simulated objects with a maximum error of 3cm, and average errors of 0.63cm, 0.66cm, 0.48cm, 0.60cm, and 0.71cm, respectively. In addition, the proposed method is able to track the trajectories of the five objects within 15 calculating cycles, and the average errors are 0.35cm, 0.39cm, 0.39cm, 1.2cm, and 0.92cm, respectively. Also, experimental results indicate that the proposed method can track the moving object with a position error band of 5cm. Conclusions of the paper can be summarized as follows: ① The proposed method is able to detect the position and velocity of moving foreign objects accurately, and the maximum error for distance measurement is within 2cm. ② The proposed method can realize presence detection and trajectory track of multiple adjacent moving objects. ③ With the capability of moving object track, the proposed method is valuable for improving reliability of living object detection, and realizing more reasonable protection. For instance, the wireless charging system can determine to lower or close the output power by considering the position range and moving trend of objects. © 2023 Chinese Machine Press.

	abstract = {AO systems aim at detecting and correcting for optical distortions induced by atmospheric turbulences. They are also extremely sensitive to extraneous sources of perturbation such as vibrations, which degrade the performance. The Gemini South telescope has currently two main AO systems: The Gemini Multi Conjugated AO System GeMS and the Gemini Planet Imager GPI. GeMS is operational and regularly used for science observation delivering close to diffraction limit resolution over a large field of view (85×85 arcsec2). Performance limitation due to the use of an integrator for tip-Tilt control is here explored. In particular, this type of controller does not allow for the mitigation of vibrations with an arbitrary natural frequency. We have thus implemented a tip-Tilt Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) controller with different underlying perturbation models: (i) a sum of autoregressive models of order 2 identified from an estimated power spectrum density (s-AR2) of the perturbation,1 already tested on CANARY2 and routinely used on SPHERE;3 (ii) cascaded ARMA models of order 2 identified using prediction error minimization (c-PEM) as proposed in.4, 5 Both s-AR2 and c-PEM were parameterized to produce tip or tilt state-space models up to order 20 and 30 respectively. We discuss the parallelized implementation in the real time computer and the expected performance. On-sky tests are scheduled during the November 2016 run or the January 2017 run. © 2016 SPIE.},

	abstract = {Previous theoretical studies have identified possible conditions for an undetectable false data injection attack (FDIA) vector that bypasses bad data detectors in power system state estimators. The formulation of the FDIA vector has attracted many researchers to propose detection algorithms. However, neither the attack formulation nor the proposed detection algorithms have been experimentally proven or validated. In this article, a framework for developing cybersecurity test beds that evaluate FDIA vectors for utility-scale distributed energy resources (DERs) and SE in real-time is proposed and implemented. The test bed is a combination of: 1) simulation models of utility-scale DER and distribution systems using OPAL-RT; 2) intelligent electronic devices (SEL-351S, SEL-311C, and SEL-3355); 3) network devices; and 4) graphical user interface (LabVIEW). The combination of actual devices, modeled systems, and cyber-physical interfaces adds realistic constraints, such as sampling error, network jitter, and data time alignment that exist during actual power system operations. Using the test bed framework, results show that the onset of the FDIA against a state estimator is experimentally detectable. Next, the test bed is used to expose an unknown vulnerability of existing phase-locked loop (PLL) techniques by presenting a new class of attack that causes PLL reporting of false phase angle and frequency values to the DER controllers. This type of attack would, then, induce the DERs to perform an adverse control action. In this article, a new detection algorithm based on a Kalman filter is evaluated to detect this type of PLL attack. A detailed evaluation of various attack scenarios is presented. The results indicate the benefits of employing this type of test bed framework to improve the development of cybersecurity defenses for realistic inverter-based DER environments.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In recent years, single-phase frequency-locked loops (FLLs) are gaining more popularity as a signal processing and synchronization tool in a wide variety of engineering applications. In the power and energy area, a basic structure in designing the majority of available single-phase FLLs is the second-order generalized integrator-based FLL (SOGI-FLL), which is a nonlinear feedback control system. This nonlinearity makes the SOGI-FLL analysis complicated. To deal with this problem, some attempts to derive linear models for the SOGI-FLL have been made in very recent years. The available linear models, however, are not able to accurately predict the dynamic behavior, stability region, and robustness metrics of the SOGI-FLL. The situation is even worse for close variants of the SOGI-FLL because some of them have no linear model at all. Filling these gaps in research is the main goal of this article. To this end, the structural relationship among the SOGI-FLL and its variants is identified first. Based on this information and deriving the linear time-periodic (LTP) model of a recently proposed extended SOGI-FLL, the LTP models of the standard SOGI-FLL and its close variants are obtained. The accuracy assessment of these LTP models, discussion about their limitations, and performing the stability analysis using them are other contributions of this article.  © 1986-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSSs), multipath propagation is still a major source of error, in particular in urban environment. Obstacles in the nearer receiver environment can reflect satellite signals leading to additional delayed signal replicas at the receiver. This causes conventional GNSS receivers to provide biased range estimates leading to Position, Velocity and Time (PVT) errors. Especially newly arising safety-relevant applications, such as autonomous cars or unmanned aerial vehicles, raise demand for high accuracy and fail-safe positioning. GNSS positioning with deviations of several meters, as it may well occur in multipath environments, would be insufficient here. A novel multi-signal Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) based multipath mitigation solution is proposed. It relies on a multicorrelator structure replacing the conventional Delay Locked Loop (DLL) code tracking. The multipath rejection is implemented through the underlying signal model of the EKF. It is incorporating the radio propagation channel between satellite and receiver, inherently accounting for reflected signal replicas. In addition to the increased resilience against multipath propagation, an estimate of the Channel Impulse Response (CIR) of the radio channel is obtained. Furthermore, this approach is also able to track in one GNSS frequency multiple signals per satellite simultaneously, exploiting the advantage of increased signal power and robustness. The functionality of the multi-signal EKF has been demonstrated with simulations and compared to a conventional receiver with a hardware GNSS constellation simulator. The results were subsequently verified with actual measurements. The proposed approach turned out to be very effective against multipath. Pseudorange errors were able to be reduced drastically leading to more accurate positioning. © 2021 Proceedings of the 34th International Technical Meeting of the Satellite Division of the Institute of Navigation, ION GNSS+ 2021.

	abstract = {Real-time and drift-free state estimation is essential for the flight control of Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs). Due to the vibration caused by the particular flapping motion and the stringent constraints of scale, weight, and power, state estimation divergence actually becomes an open challenge for flapping wing platforms’ longterm stable flight. Unlike conventional MAVs, the direct adoption of mature state estimation strategies, such as inertial or vision-based methods, has difficulty obtaining satisfactory sensing performance on flapping wing platforms. Inertial sensors offer high sampling frequency but suffer from flapping-introduced oscillation and drift. External visual sensors, such as motion capture systems, can provide accurate feedback but come with a relatively low sampling rate and severe delay. This work proposes a novel state estimation framework to combine the merits from both to address such key sensing challenges of a special flapping wing platform— micro flapping wing rotors (FWRs). In particular, a cross-fusion scheme, which integrates two alternately updated Extended Kalman Filters based on a convex combination, is proposed to tightly fuse both onboard inertial and external visual information. Such a design leverages both the high sampling rate of the inertial feedback and the accuracy of the external vision-based feedback. To address the sensing delay of the visual feedback, a ring buffer is designed to cache historical states for online drift compensation. Experimental validations have been conducted on two sophisticated microFWRs with different actuation and control principles. Both of them show realtime and drift-free state estimation. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Real-time state estimation and forecasting are critical for the efficient operation of power grids. In this paper, a physics-informed Gaussian process regression (PhI-GPR) method is presented and used for forecasting and estimating the phase angle, angular speed, and wind mechanical power of a three-generator power grid system using sparse measurements. In standard data-driven Gaussian process regression (GPR), parameterized models for the prior statistics are fit by maximizing the marginal likelihood of observed data. In the PhI-GPR method, we propose to compute the prior statistics offline by solving stochastic differential equations (SDEs) governing the power grid dynamics. The short-term forecast of a power grid system dominated by wind generation is complicated by the stochastic nature of the wind and the resulting uncertainty in wind mechanical power. Here, we assume that the power grid dynamics are governed by swing equations, with the wind mechanical power fluctuating randomly in time. We solve these equations for the mean and covariances of the power grid states using the Monte Carlo simulation method. We demonstrate that the proposed PhI-GPR method can accurately forecast and estimate observed and unobserved states. For the considered problem, PhI-GPR has computational advantages over the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) method: In PhI-GPR, ensembles are computed offline and independently of the data acquisition process, whereas for EnFK, ensembles are computed online with data acquisition, rendering real-time forecast more challenging. We also demonstrate that the PhI-GPR forecast is more accurate than the EnKF forecast when the random mechanical wind power is non-Markovian. In contrast, the two methods produce similar forecasts for the Markovian mechanical wind power. For observed states, we show that PhI-GPR provides a forecast comparable to the standard data-driven GPR; both forecasts are significantly more accurate than the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) forecast. We also show that the ARIMA forecast is more sensitive to observation frequency and measurement errors than the PhI-GPR forecast. © 2022 International Institute of Forecasters},

	abstract = {In feedforward active noise and vibration control (ANVC) or active noise control (ANC), with online secondary path modeling, fast converging overall modeling algorithms may give high modeling errors. These errors are due to the highly correlated inputs, namely the reference and antinoise signals. These high modeling errors can result in poor performance if ignored. However, it is possible to consider these modeling errors in the control filter design, resulting in a careful controller and good performance, as proposed in this work. Careful control is a dual controller feature, which is the solution to the optimal control problem, but this has not been proposed before in the context of ANC. The modeling error covariance matrix (Sigma(n)) is available in the Kalman filter. However, this requires the knowledge of the time-varying measurement noise power q(n) and state noise. Instead, this work uses a different approach in which the corresponding linear system is solved in a non-recursive manner. The resulting maximum error is used for a worst-case estimate of q(n), and, as it turns out, this can be used to get a worst-case estimate of Sigma(n). A lower control filter update frequency and other optimizations keep computational complexity similar to other approaches. The resulting algorithm has very few easily selected parameters, good performance, does not require any prior secondary path estimate, and adapts to slow and sudden changes in the physical paths without loss of performance or noise overshoots. However, performance can be impaired by large background noise levels. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {Interference alignment (IA) is a promising interference management technique to efficiently eliminate multiuser interference in a K-user interference network. However, channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter is indispensable for the interference alignment precoding matrices design. In spite of the fact that the CSI can be obtained through feedback from receivers to transmitters in a frequency-division duplex (FDD) system or through the reciprocity in a time-division duplex (TDD) system, it may be imperfect for the reason such as estimation inaccuracy, feedback delay and time-varying of channel. In this paper, the impact of imperfect CSI on the achievable sum rate of interference alignment network is considered and a channel prediction technique based on Kalman filtering is proposed to verify the theoretical analysis. Through analysing, we find that the sum rate performance of an interference aligned network is affected by an integrated parameter, i.e., the product of user number, transmit power and channel error variance. Simulation results reveal that the performance of interference alignment is more sensitive to the uncertainty of CSI at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime than that at low SNR regime. It is also verified that the performance can be improved through channel prediction, comparing with interference alignment based on the delayed feedback CSI. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {These last decades spawned a great interest toward low-power high-frequency (HF) surface-wave (SW) radars for ocean remote sensing. By virtue of their over-the-horizon coverage capability and continuous-time mode of operation, these sensors are also effective long-range early warning tools in maritime situational awareness applications providing an additional source of information for target detection and tracking. Unfortunately, they also exhibit many shortcomings that need to be taken into account, and proper algorithms need to be exploited to overcome their limitations. In this paper, we develop a knowledge-based (KB) multitarget tracking methodology that takes advantage of a priori information on the ship traffic. This a priori information is given by the ship sea lanes and by their related motion models, which together constitute the basic building blocks of a variable structure interactive multiple model procedure. False alarms and missed detections are dealt with using a joint probabilistic data association rule and nonlinearities are handled by means of the unscented Kalman filter. The KB-tracking procedure is validated using real data acquired during an HF-radar experiment in the Ligurian Sea (Mediterranean Sea). Two HFSW radar systems were operated to develop and test target detection and tracking algorithms. The overall performance is defined in terms of time-on-target, false-alarm rate (FAR), track fragmentation (TF), and accuracy. A full statistical characterization is provided using one month of data. A significant improvement of the KB-tracking procedure, in terms of system performance, is demonstrated in comparison with a standard joint probabilistic data association tracker recently proposed in the literature to track HFSW radar data. The main improvement of our approach is the better capability of following targets without increasing the FAR. This increment is much more evident in the region of low FAR, where it can be over the 30% for both the HFSW radar systems. The KB-tracking exhibits on average a reduction of the TF of about the 20% and the 13% of the utilized HFSW-radar systems. © 1980-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Most active fire detection algorithms applied to data from geostationary Earth Observation (EO) satellites are adjustments of those originally developed for polar-orbiting systems, and thus the high temporal imaging frequencies offered from geostationary systems are often not fully utilized within such detection approaches. Here we present a new active fire detection algorithm that fully exploits geostationary data's temporal dimension, including both for detecting actively burning fires and quantifying their fire radiative power (FRP). The approach uses a robust matching algorithm to model each pixels diurnal temperature cycle (DTC) in the middle infra-red (MIR) spectral band, the most important band for active fire detection. For each pixel, a Kalman filter (KF) is used to blend the set of basis DTCs with the actual geostationary observations during times of confirmed cloud- and fire-free measurements, allowing for estimates of the pixels true non-fire 'background' signal to be provided throughout the day, even when a fire maybe present. This is different to the standard 'spatial contextual' approach, where the non-fire background signal is estimated from nearby non-fire pixels. A series of spectral thresholds are then applied to the analyzed pixel in order to identify whether the actual observation departs sufficiently from the estimated non-fire signal to confidently suggest that the pixel contains an active fire. If it does, the difference between the fire pixel and non-fire background signal estimate in the MIR is used to estimate the fire radiative power (FRP) output. We apply this new 'Kalman Filter Algorithm' (KFA) to one month of African imagery acquired by the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI), which is carried onboard the geostationary Meteosat satellite. We compare the resulting active fire detections and FRPs to those produced using the prototype (offline) version of the 'spatial contextual' based 'Fire Thermal Anomalies' (FTA) algorithm, here termed the pFTA, now used to generate the operational SEVIRI FRP-PIXEL product in the EUMETSAT Land Surface Analysis Satellite Applications Facility (http://landsaf.meteo.pt/), and also compare results to simultaneous detections from the MODIS MOD14/MYD14 active fire products. The KFA shows some advantages over the pFTA algorithm, detecting a greater number of fire pixels, up to ~. 80% more at the peak of the diurnal fire cycle. These additional fire pixels are primarily low FRP fires (<. 30. MW), which results in the overall fire radiative energy (FRE) increasing by only 20% compared to the pFTA algorithm, though this is still a substantial difference. Comparison against simultaneous MODIS active fire observations confirms that the KFA detects more of the MODIS-detected active fires than does the pFTA (60% more), but at the expense of doubling the false alarm rate. Analysis of the ability of the KFA to aid in the estimation of FRP by providing a more certain estimate of the fire pixels background signal indicates a small 0.2. K reduction (rmsd) between the 'estimate' of the background temperature and the 'truth'. One limitation of the KFA approach currently is that it is computationally costly, and also requires the full day diurnal variation to be measured prior to the multi-temporal fire detection process. In its present form it is therefore unsuited to the generation of real-time products. We recommend future work concentrate on extracting maximum performance and utility of geostationary active fire observations by blending both 'spatial contextual' and 'multi-temporal' approaches. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

The method consists in applying iteratively a data assimilation step, here an ensemble Kalman filter, and a neural network. Data assimilation is used to optimally combine a surrogate model with sparse noisy data. The output analysis is spatially complete and is used as a training set by the neural network to update the surrogate model. The two steps are then repeated iteratively. Numerical experiments have been carried out using the chaotic 40-variables Lorenz 96 model, proving both convergence and statistical skill of the proposed hybrid approach. The surrogate model shows short-term forecast skill up to two Lyapunov times, the retrieval of positive Lyapunov exponents as well as the more energetic frequencies of the power density spectrum. The sensitivity of the method to critical setup parameters is also presented: the forecast skill decreases smoothly with increased observational noise but drops abruptly if less than half of the model domain is observed. The successful synergy between data assimilation and machine learning, proven here with a low-dimensional system, encourages further investigation of such hybrids with more sophisticated dynamics. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

In the control method, the resonant-two-degree-of-freedom (R-2DOF) proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller is proposed by combining a resonant controller and a two-degree-of-freedom (2DOF) PID controller. The current harmonic components are first analyzed. The resonant controller is subsequently added to the current loop in parallel to the traditional PI controller to suppress the current harmonic components. However, with the current harmonics suppression, the resonant controller can result in the overshoot in the current loop response. The 2DOF PID controller is adopted to reduce the overshoot. Thus, an R-2DOF PID controller is developed by combining the resonant controller and 2DOF PID controller. Meanwhile, the stability of the proposed controller is analyzed. Compared with the traditional PID controller and the Kalman filter, the proposed controller not only can suppress the current harmonics but can reduce the overshoot and thrust ripple as well. Finally, the simulation and experimental comparison results confirm the validity of the proposed control algorithm. © 1982-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {As one of the key candidate technologies for 5G, the non-orthogonal multiple access technology (NOMA) employs the power domain reuse to raise the system throughput and frequency utilization effectively. Among the existing works about the NOMA system, it has been mostly assumed that the folding signal is completely synchronous. However, in the actual applications, the folding signal may not be completely synchronous due to the difference of users’ location and status. Aiming at the time-delay problem of folding signal transmission during different users, this paper proposes a new successive interference cancellation algorithm. Firstly, the superposed signals are asynchronously sampled and a series of constructional output data are obtained. And then, according to the overlap part of each adjacent symbol, a symbol is reconstructed by adopting a new successive interference cancellation strategy in the receiving terminal. It is shown from the results that the proposed method can obtain cleaner exceptional properties of the interference signal cancellation at the cost of adding complexity of signal reconstruction. Since this structure will result in the error expansion problem and affect the detection and reconstruction of all subsequent signals, it is more stringent for the requirement on the accuracy of each signal estimation and the channel estimation. Hence, this paper adopts the scalar Kalman filter algorithm to estimate the channel status information such that more accurate channel states in the time direction can be obtained. These can bring great improvement on the error detection performance of the entire signal detection such that the proposed algorithm in this paper is more applicable to the actual signal estimation. © 2019, Editorial Department of Journal of East China University of Science and Technology.

	abstract = {Distribution-level phasor measurement units (D-PMU) data are prone to different types of anomalies given complex data flow and processing infrastructure in an active power distribution system with enhanced digital automation. It is essential to preprocess the data before being used by critical applications for situational awareness and control. In this work, two approaches for detection of data anomalies are introduced for offline (larger data processing window) and online (shorter data processing window) applications. A smoothing wavelet denoising method is used to remove high-frequency noises. An ensemble approach built upon the margin-based maximum likelihood estimator (MB-MLE) method is developed to detect anomalies in denoised data by integration of the results from different base detectors including Hampel filter, Quartile detector, and DBSCAN. The processed data with offline analysis is used to fit a model to the underlying dynamics of synchrophasor data using Koopman mode analysis, which is subsequently employed for online denoising and bad data detection using Kalman filter (KF). The parameters of the KF are adjusted adaptively based on similarity to the training dataset for model fitting purposes. Developed techniques have been validated for the modified IEEE test system with multiple D-PMUs, modeled and simulated in real-time for different case scenarios using the OPAL-RT hardware-in-the-loop simulator.  © 1972-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Planet owns and operates the RapidEye constellation, which consists of five Earth observation satellites in sun synchronous orbits, phased to provide a daily revisit capability to regions between +/-84 degrees latitude. Collectively, the constellation records approximately 5 million square kilometers of high resolution multispectral imagery per day and has been in continuous operation for the past 8 years. The satellites are expected to maintain nominal operations until their Lithium-Ion batteries reach approximately 50% of their original 15 Ah capacities, at which point they will continue to function but in a degraded operational mode. As the satellites have now exceeded their 7.25 year design life, it is becoming increasingly imperative to accurately estimate their remaining battery capacities and develop a comprehensive strategy to maximize their operational life times. PROTOS is a tool developed by Planet to calculate the current state of the RapidEye satellite power systems and simulate different operational scenarios and their impact on the capacity fade of the batteries. The tool uses a Kalman filter to estimate the depth of discharge (DoD) of each battery, combining Coulomb counting measurements with battery voltage telemetry. The original RapidEye battery manufacturers, ABSL, produced a set of battery fade plots which project the theoretical degradation of the batteries under certain operational conditions (i.e. number of cycles, maximum life average DoD, maximum battery temperature). PROTOS combines these idealized capacity fade predictions with actual battery temperature telemetry and the calculated DoD values to develop a linearized battery capacity fade model which estimates the "mission life" of each satellite, the date when each battery reaches 50% capacity. PROTOS is also designed to test various operational scenarios and their impact on the satellite mission life. It contains a spacecraft power simulator developed to emulate the generation, storage and consumption of power onboard the RapidEye satellites. Mission parameters, including the duration, frequency and latitude of data recordings, downlink timing, heater and propulsion usage, etc., were used as design variables and mapped back to the duty cycles of specific satellite subsystems. Constraints were selected for each parameter to ensure solutions met certain minimum mission criteria, such as daily coverage area, temperature limits, etc. Finally, a genetic algorithm was used in conjunction with PROTOS to optimize the design parameters for maximum mission life. Based on this optimized solution, the RapidEye data collection strategy was modified to mitigate battery fade, resulting in an estimated 15% increase of satellite mission life.

	abstract = {The dynamic high-precision measurement of fertilizer application rate is a prerequisite for implementing variable fertilization. Although there are various methods for measuring fertilizer quality and flow in the field, there are still some problems such as inaccurate measurement and inability to adapt to the working environment when applying to the field. A microwave-based particle fertilizer mass flow measurement system was developed. A flow mass measurement model and method were proposed, and the agricultural granular fertilizer Stanley 15 15 15 and Sacokufu 15 15 15 were used as the experimental object. The microwave sensor distance and fertilizer discharge rate were controlled, and the data was smoothed by using a Kalman filter. The experiment achieved good results. The analysis of experimental data showed that the dominant frequency of the particle fertilizer echo signal was only related to the distance between the electric fertilizer discharge device and the sensor, while the power spectral density was only related to the number of fertilizer particles. By using the least squares method, the response relationship between the two compound fertilizers, Qt and Sval, was established. The determination coefficient R of the response relationship between the two types of compound fertilizers was not less than 0. 985 8, and the response relationships were validated. The measurement range for Sacokufu 15 15 15 was 1 119. 8 -2 065. 9 g/min, with a maximum measurement error of 6. 35%. The measurement range for Stanley 15 15 15 was 1 071. 9-1 877. 9 g/min, with a maximum measurement error of 4. 85%. Its measurement performance fulfilled the operational needs of the task. © 2023 Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Millimeter wave (mmWave) system is a key technology for the fifth generation (5G). Precoding techniques can be applied in the radio frequency (RF) stage to achieve spatial multiplexing gain. Studying the problems of hardware imperfections in the RF stage for mmWave communication system is very important because it can affect the transmitted signals and overall system performance. In this article, mmWave MIMO system under phase noise problem is proposed. In addition, an optimization problem for the design of hybrid precoder under phase noise is formulated. An alternating minimization algorithm using manifold optimization is proposed to close the performance of the fully digital precoder. A realistic power consumption model is considered. To estimate the mmWave channel parameters and to track the phase noise parameters, a Bayesian Cramér-Rao lower bounds (BCRLBs), Kalman filter, least square (LS) and maximum a posterior (MAP) algorithms are proposed. Furthermore, the proposed system with ideal hardware mmWave system is compared with non-ideal system under amplified thermal noise and residual additive transceiver hardware impairments. Spectral efficiencies (SEs) of the proposed system are provided with different scenarios. The analytical and simulation tests show that the influence of phase noise problem may decrease SE performance, especially at higher phase noise. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Data assimilation for systems possessing many scales of motions is a substantial methodological and technological challenge. Systems with these features are found in many areas of computational physics and are becoming common thanks to increased computational power allowing to resolve finer scales and to couple together several sub-components. Coupled data assimilation (CDA) distinctively appears as a main concern in numerical weather and climate prediction with major efforts put forward by meteo services worldwide. The core issue is the scale separation acting as a barrier that hampers the propagation of the information across model components (e.g. ocean and atmosphere). We provide a brief survey of CDA, and then focus on CDA using the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), a widely used Monte Carlo Gaussian method. Our goal is to elucidate the mechanisms behind information propagation across model components. We consider first a coupled system of equations with temporal scale difference, and deduce that: (i) cross components effects are strong from the slow to the fast scale, but, (ii) intra-component effects are much stronger in the fast scale. While observing the slow scale is desirable and benefits the fast, the latter must be observed with high frequency otherwise the error will grow up to affect the slow scale. Numerical experiments are performed using the atmosphere-ocean model, MAOOAM. Six configurations are considered, differing for the strength of the atmosphere-ocean coupling and/or the number of model modes. The performance of the EnKF depends on the model configuration, i.e. on its dynamical features. A comprehensive dynamical characterisation of the model configurations is provided by examining the Lyapunov spectrum, Kolmogorov entropy and Kaplan–Yorke attractor dimension. We also compute the covariant Lyapunov vectors and use them to explain how model instabilities act on different model’s modes according to the coupling strength. The experiments confirm the importance of observing the fast scale, but show also that, despite its slow temporal scale, frequent observations in the ocean are beneficial. The relation between the ensemble size, N, and the unstable subspace dimension, n, has been studied. Results largely ratify what known for uncoupled system: the condition N≥ n is necessary for the EnKF to work satisfactorily. Nevertheless the quasi-degeneracy of the Lyapunov spectrum of MAOOAM, with many near-zero exponents, is potentially the cause of the smooth gradual reduction of the analysis error observed for some model configurations, even when N> n. Future prospects for the EnKF in the context of coupled ocean-atmosphere systems are finally discussed. © 2020, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The advent of wearable technology has enabled a large number of externally worn mechatronic devices to be developed and tested on people with movement disorders. The complexity of these disorders and the variety of conditions across different patients have resulted in a pressing demand for the incorporation of intelligent control systems, especially for a wearable tremor suppression device (WTSD) that can suppress tremor without impeding the user's voluntary motion. Several devices have been developed to reduce tremor; however, the evaluations of these devices have only been done in a controlled lab setting, while the functionality and ability to avoid user injury under the effect of disturbances during daily use have not been investigated. In this study, the performance of a WTSD was tested with several commonly used tremor suppression control systems, i.e., Weight-frequency Fourier Linear Combiner (WFLC), Bandlimited Multiple Fourier Linear Combiner, and enhanced High-order WFLC-based Kalman Filter, on a bench-top tremor simulator. These systems were also tested under the influence of three simulated disturbances that are commonly seen in real life, i.e., data mutation, sensor drift, and measurement loss. The experimental evaluation showed that none of these systems are safe under the disturbances. The tremor power suppression ratio (67.8%-94.2%) of the WTSD was not significantly lowered by the disturbances; however, the error when tracking voluntary motion significantly increased by 8.8$^\circ$-93.6$^\circ$, which may present a safety hazard to the users. The results of this study emphasize the importance of integrating safety measures into intelligent WTSDs.  © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Electrocardiogram (ECG) is considered as the important diagnostic tests in medical field for detecting the cardiac anomalies. But, the ECG signals are polluted with numerous noise from power line intrusion, muscle noise, baseline wander, motion artifacts, low frequency noise signals, high frequency noise signals and T-wave, which automatically a®ects the QRS profile. The existing method provides the result in lesser accuracy with higher rate of error detection. To overcome these issues, QRS detector using modified maximum mean minimum (MoMaMeMi) filter optimized with mayfly optimization algorithm (QRS-MoMaMeMi-MOA) is proposed in this paper for less computational cost along with resource requirements. The proposed filter design consists of two phases for detecting QRS detector, such as filtering process associated to the enhancement and detection phase. Initially, the ECG data are taken from MIT/BIH arrhythmia dataset (MIT-AD). For eradicating the baseline wander in ECG data, MaMeMi filter is used. For expanding the performance of the modified MaMeMi filter, filter parameters, such as are optimized by MOA to accomplish the best values and measure the performance of the whole QRS detector. For high frequency noise suppression in ECG data, the range function, noise subtractors, modified triangular detector are used. Then, heart beat detection can be done with the help of adaptive thresholding technique. The proposed filter design is carried out in MATLAB and implemented on field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). The proposed QRS-MoMaMeMi-MOA filter design had 0.93%, 0.12% and 0.19% higher accuracy and 89.32%, 50% and 62% low detection error rate, compared to the existing filters, like Kalman filtering based adaptive threshold algorithm for QRS complex detection (QRS-KF-ATA), QRS detection of ECG signal utilizing hybrid derivative with MaMeMi filter by efficiently removing the baseline wander (QRS-HD-MaMeMi), and knowledge-based QRS detection operated by cascade of moving average filters (QRS-CAF). Then, the device utilization of the proposed FPGA implementation of the QRS-MoMaMeMi-MOA filter provides 95.556% and 71.428% lower power usage compared with the existing algorithms, like Kalman filtering based adaptive threshold algorithm for QRS complex detection in FPGA (FPGA-QRS-KF-ATA), and efficient architecture for QRS detection in FPGA utilizing integer Haar wavelet transform (FPGA-QRS-IHWT). © World Scientific Publishing Company.},

	abstract = {Real-time kinematic (RTK) is a technique frequently utilized to provide real-time highly precise positioning services for mobile Internet-of-Things (IoT)-embedded terminals from intelligence appliances and smartphones to autonomous drones and self-driving vehicles. To fully utilize hardware resources, the internal GNSS chips or modules equipped in IoT terminals should satisfy the traits of energy efficiency and low computational complexity. As the number of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) increases, the continuous accumulation of high-dimensional rounding errors, the rough system model, and seriously distorted observations will result in divergence and considerable processing burden in the conventional Kalman filter (KF) process. Computational efficiency is significant in the reduction in the power consumption and intensifies the positioning performance of GNSS receivers. Here, a new filter strategy based on UD factorization, where U stands for the unit upper-triangular factor and D indicates the diagonal factor, is proposed for RTK positioning to enhance the numerical stability and reduce the computational effort. The equivalent principle was applied to turn double-difference (DD) observations into zero-difference (ZD) observations. Then, the UD-factorization-based Kalman filter (UD-KF) is proposed as a way to sequentially provide accurate real-time estimations of the filter states and variance–covariance (VC) matrix. Both static and dynamic tests were carried out with single-frequency data from a GPS to evaluate the performance of UD-KF. The results of the zero-baseline test show that UD-KF can obtain smaller RMS of the estimated parameters as the noise of DD observations was twice that of the ZD observations. A short baseline test showed that, compared to the regular filter approach with DD observations, UD-KF achieved a shorter computation time with a higher data utilization rate for both filtering and fixing stages, with an average improvement of 32% and 18%. Finally, a dynamic test showed that the UD-KF can avoid the undesirable effect of satellite changes. Therefore, compared to KF with DD observations, the UD-KF with equivalent ZD observations can enhance the robustness as well as improve the positioning accuracy of RTK positioning. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {An implicit assumption made in studies on state estimation is that the time and frequency at which these measurements are taken is consistent across all the distributed sensing sites. For instance, in the literatures on Wide Area Measurement Systems (WAMS) deployed in the power grid, where the sensors equipped with Global Positioning Signals (GPS), the sensing sites are deemed capable to provide perfectly synchronous readings at the various sampling sites. The validity of the assumption may need to be re-examined with the recent advancements in decentralized state estimation algorithms. Importantly, when there are timing offsets between sampling devices, the effects on the measurement system's performance can be catastrophic. The prevalent point of view is to either study the resulting error, or to resort to Kalman filtering for aligning the measurements. Taking on this view typically requires additional information about the underlying state. In this paper, we revisit the problem of state estimation and propose a new model for data acquisition under asynchronous sampling. The key idea is to apply sampling theory and to exploit the redundancy in the spatial sampling to interpolate the system state. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition for identifiability of the time offsets and propose an algorithm for the joint regression on state and timing offsets. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is shown by numerical simulations. © 2014 IEEE.},

To overcome the lack of wireless resources, we propose a machine learning-based solution, where only one control system is controlled, while the rest of the control systems are actuated by locally predicting the missing state and/or action information using the previous uplink and/or downlink receptions via a Gaussian process regression (GPR). This GPR prediction credibility is determined using the age-of-information (AoI) of the latest reception. Moreover, the successful reception is affected by the transmission power, mandating a co-design of the communication and control operations. To this end, we formulate a network-wide minimization problem of the average AoI and transmission power under communication reliability and control stability constraints. To solve the problem, we propose a dynamic control algorithm using the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty optimization framework. Numerical results corroborate that the proposed algorithm can stably control 2× more number of actuators compared to an event-triggered scheduling baseline with Kalman filtering and frequency division multiple access, which is 18× larger than a round-robin scheduling baseline. © 1972-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Precise positioning on a medium earth orbit (MEO) seems to be less demanding than on earth due to the lack of atmospheric delays and the reduced signal shadowing by earth. Nevertheless there are several challenges for positioning on very high altitudes like high Doppler shift or the limited signal visibility due to out-of-lobe areas. While signal visibility, especially in higher altitudes, has improved and will further improve due to the increasing number of GNSS satellites, receiver adjustments are still needed for that environment beside considerations regarding tolerance of cosmic radiation. Off-the-shelf receivers do not provide navigation informaion at velocities exceeding 600 m/s due to dual-use reaons. Satellites on an earth orbit move with more than 7000 m/s on low altitudes and even still more than 3000 m/s on a geosynchronous orbit. On an eccentric orbit even higher maximum speeds can be reached, which excludes off-the-shelf receivers (even in a simulation environment) from orbit based applications. The Institute of Flight Guidance (IFF) has developed a software based GNSS receiver. It is implemented in C++, while the receiver tracking routines are based on NVIDIA CUDA and enable the receiver to track several dozens of signals in real-time, depending on the GPU processing power as shown at the ION GNSS 2012 ([1]). The digiized signals can be provided by different types of receiver front-ends and are sent to the receiver via USB. The receiver is able to process GPS, Galileo and SBAS signals. Since software based solution is fully adaptable to special applications, it can be adjusted for precise positioning on an earth orbit as well. The receiver has particularly been adapted with respect to signal availability and accuracy in order to fit the requirements on an earth orbit. The tracking has been changed from scalar control procedures to a vector based code and carrier frequency tracking routine, in which a Kalman based state estimator controls the tracking states. Since the movement on an orbit can be predicted very precisely, a dynamic model has been derived to describe the Kepler mechanics and therefore reduce the average measurement residuals in the correction step of the Kalman filter. In order to estimate the influence of the receiver dynamic on the measurements, maximum values for Doppler shift and Doppler rate were derived for worst-case scenarios. Further considerations in this paper are due to relativistic effects on the Doppler measurements. Copyright © (2014) by the Institute of Navigation All rights reserved.},

Model predictive control (MPC)based centralized optimization is used to optimize the locations of a team of AUVs along a cross-stream transect. To maintain an accurate estimate of the transect flow profile, a Kalman filter-based estimator is used to blend flow speed measurements from the AUVs with intermittent auxiliary flow speed data from a High Frequency Radar Network (HFRNet). To characterize the uncertainty of the GS flow profile estimation, variance of flow speed is modeled using tools from Gaussian Process (GP). The MPC strategy proposed in the paper ensures an appropriate balance between learning the exact location of GS jet (termed exploration) and maximizing overall power generation (termed exploitation). The importance of estimating the flow pattern in the transect with high resolution is shown through simulation results. © 2019 IEEE.},

For convenient application, the equivalent concentrated forces are taken as the inversing objects, representing the distributed wind forces on a lattice tower. The corresponding equivalent cantilever model of the lattice tower is utilized, in which the stiffness matrix is estimated by a modified flexibility approach. Based on the modal superposition principle, the dynamic wind forces in physical space are reconstructed using the identified input modal wind forces. The scheme of the dynamic wind force reconstruction is designed in detail. A typical transmission steel lattice tower is considered, and the aeroelastic wind tunnel experiments are performed. The performance and effectiveness of the proposed scheme are investigated based on numerical simulations and wind tunnel tests. It is indicated that the reconstructed dynamic wind forces can produce equivalent dynamic responses to the actual. Besides, it performs robustly on the effect of measurement noise. Although the modal force identification is sensitive to the modeling error of structural natural frequency, the effect can be judged according to the change in the power spectra of the identified modal force. The proposed inversing approach can serve as a useful tool to evaluate dynamic wind forces on steel lattice towers with limited response measurements. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new concept in active damping techniques using a reduced model of an LCL-filtered grid-connected inverter. The presence of the LCL filter complicates the design of the inverter control scheme, particularly when uncertainties in the system parameters, especially in the grid inductance, are considered. The proposed control algorithm is addressed to overcome such difficulties using a reduced model of the inverter in a state observer. In this proposal, two of the three state variables of the system are obviated from the physical inverter model, and only the inverter-side current is considered. Therefore, the inverter-side current can be estimated emulating the case of an inverter with only one inductor, thus eliminating the resonance problem produced by the LCL filter. Besides, in the case of a distorted grid, the method allows us to estimate the voltages at the point of common coupling free of noise and distortion without using any phase-locked loop based synchronization algorithm. This proposal provides the following features to the closed-loop system: first, robust and simple active damping control under system parameters deviation; second, robustness against grid voltage unbalance and distortion; and third, an important reduction in the computational load of the control algorithm, which allows us to increase the switching frequency. To complete the control scheme, a theoretical stability analysis is developed considering the effect of the observer, the system discretization, and the system parameters deviation. Experimental and comparative evaluation results are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The side effects and complications of traditional treatments for treating pathological tremor have led to a growing research interest in wearable tremor suppression devices (WTSDs) as an alternative approach. Similar to how the human brain coordinates the function of the human system, a tremor estimator determines how a WTSD functions. Although many tremor estimation algorithms have been developed and validated, whether they can be implemented on a cost-effective embedded system has not been studied; furthermore, their effectiveness on tremor signals with multiple harmonics has not been investigated. Therefore, in this study, four tremor estimators were implemented, evaluated, and compared: Weighted-frequency Fourier Linear Combiner (WFLC), WFLC-based Kalman Filter (WFLC-KF), Band-limited Multiple FLC, and enhanced High-order WFLC-KF (eHWFLC-KF). This study aimed to evaluate the performance of each algorithm on a bench-top tremor suppression system with 18 recorded tremor motion datasets; and compare the performance of each estimator. The experimental evaluation showed that the eHWFLC-KF-based WTSD achieved the best performance when suppressing tremor with an average of 89.3% reduction in tremor power, and an average error when tracking voluntary motion of 6.6°/s. Statistical analysis indicated that the eHWFLC-KF-based WTSD is able to reduce the power of tremor better than the WFLC and WFLC-KF, and the BMFLC-based WTSD is better than the WFLC. The performance when tracking voluntary motion is similar among all systems. This study has proven the feasibility of implementing various tremor estimators in a cost-effective embedded system, and provided a real-time performance assessment of four tremor estimators.  © 2001-2011 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Network control, optimization, and security analysis are facilitated by accurate microgrid state estimation. By utilizing phasor measurement units (PMUs), a combined robust centralized dynamic algebraic approach is proposed in this paper for estimating algebraic states (voltage phasors) as well as dynamic states (associated with synchronous generators and wind turbines). Assuming that a load is placed on each bus, an innovative PMU placement method is also presented to provide measurements for all dynamic and algebraic state variables. As a robust link between algebraic state estimation and dynamic state estimation, the output results of the least absolute value (LAV) estimator, which is robust against bad data, are fed to dynamic state estimators as pseudo measurements. Next, to address the nonlinearity of synchronous generator and wind turbine models, an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) is applied to estimate dynamic states precisely. The numerical tests on a microgrid test system show that the suggested approach is suitable for both algebraic and dynamic state estimation. Synchronous generators and wind turbines are modeled using nonlinear models of the 9th and third orders, respectively, and static loads are modeled as voltage-frequency dependent ones. © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {Traditional contact voltage measurement requires a direct electrical connection to the system, which is not easy to install and maintain. The voltage measurement based on the electric field coupling plate capacitance structure does not need to be in contact with the measured object or the ground, which can avoid the above problems. However, most of the existing flat-plate structure voltage measurement sensors are not only expensive to manufacture, but also bulky, and when the relative position between the wire under test and the sensor changes, it will bring great measurement errors, making it difficult to meet actual needs. Aiming to address the above problems, this paper proposes a multi-electrode array structure non-contact voltage sensor and signal processing algorithm. The sensor is manufactured by the PCB process, which effectively reduces the manufacturing cost and process difficulty. The experimental and simulation results show that, when the relative position of the wire and the sensor is offset by 10 mm in the 45° direction, the relative error of the traditional single-electrode voltage sensor is 17.62%, while the relative error of the multi-electrode voltage sensor designed in this paper is only 0.38%. In addition, the ratio error of the sensor under the condition of power frequency of 50 Hz is less than ±1% and the phase difference is less than 4°. The experimental results show that the sensor has good accuracy and linearity. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {As transmission and distribution networks now span a wider region, the difficulty of monitoring lines and the incidence of faults are both increased, which reduces the stability of the power system. During the troubleshooting procedure, quick problem identification, line selection, and placement are essential, and non-contact current measurement can be quite helpful. Its advantages include the capacity to monitor high-frequency current and line space position, both of which contain a range of fault characteristics, as well as a high-frequency band, compact size, low cost, and simple installation. In this paper, we present an adaptive positioning current measurement method for multi-conductor systems based on a linear magnetic sensor array. The method detects the position shifts of individual conductors when their locations are displaced to varying degrees using a novel conductor positioning calculation algorithm. Besides, it automatically adjusts the measurement matrix to provide precise current measurements. In the simulations, three-phase parallel currents with an amplitude of 100 A are analyzed based on the parameters of a 15-meter cup-type tensile tower. During the different displacements of the three conductors, the new method calculates the conductor displacements and the current in real-time. For all the three conductor positions change with the maximum amplitude of 2 m, the average error of all the conductor position measurements is about 0.1 m, and the root mean square error (RMSE) of the currents drops from 34.18A to 3.72A with correction, which proves the effectiveness of the algorithm. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Solar oscillation, which causes the sunlight intensity and spectrum frequency change, has been studied in great detail, both observationally and theoretically. In this paper, owing to the existence of solar oscillation, the time delay between the sunlight coming from the Sun directly and the sunlight reflected by the other celestial body such as the satellite of planet or asteroid can be obtained with two optical power meters. Because the solar oscillation time delay is determined by the relative positions of the spacecraft, reflective celestial body and the Sun, it can be adopted as the navigation measurement to estimate the spacecraft's position. The navigation accuracy of single solar oscillation time delay navigation system depends on the time delay measurement accuracy, and is influenced by the distance between spacecraft and reflective celestial body. In this paper, we combine it with the star angle measurement and propose a solar oscillation time delay measurement assisted celestial navigation method for deep space exploration. Since the measurement model of time delay is an implicit function, the Implicit Unscented Kalman Filter (IUKF) is applied. Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of this method. © 2017 IAA},

However, chattering in SMC may deteriorate the tracking accuracy and can easily excite high-frequency unmodeled dynamics. To solve this problem, this article presents a fuzzy-fractional-order nonsingular terminal sliding-mode controller (Fuzzy-FONTSMC) for the grid current control of LCL-GCCs. First, the system modeling, design of the integer-order NTSMC controller, and state estimation based on the Kalman filter to minimize the sampling sensors are described. Second, the Fuzzy-FONTSMC controller is introduced for optimal fraction-order selection and chattering mitigation, this controller exhibits fast convergence with high tracking accuracy and strong robustness.

	abstract = {The state-of-health (SoH) estimation based on the constant-voltage (CV) charging data has been an interesting research topic in recent years. However, most of the existing estimation methods based on CV charging data are sensitive to the cut-off condition and/or require a relatively high storage resource as well as computing power, preventing the feasibility in real world applications. To extend the scope of the estimation method based on CV charging data, this paper proposes a quick and robust battery capacity estimation method using a two-layer CV charging time (TCV)-based model. First, the evolution of TCV-based SoH model with respect to different cut-off currents is investigated, and the detailed mathematical expressions of the model coefficients are derived based on the decoupled dynamic characteristics of the CV charging current. Second, considering the actual sampling periods (Tss) utilized in the online application, a Ts-adaptive moving average filter is proposed to filter the high-frequency measurement noise. Third, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can determine SoH with a root-mean-square error of less than 2.05% for two types of tested batteries under different charging protocols. In addition, the comparison study further highlights the superiority of the proposed method in terms of robustness, accuracy, computational cost, and storage consumption. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Objective: With the development of unmanned aerial vehicle(UAV) technology, the identification and ranging of small targets at long ranges have become an essential defense requirement. The Swedish defense research agency investigates a linear detected laser range lidar for target recognition and classification, such as small boats at sea and small UAV. However, to measure a small target at long range, the linear detected lidar requires a high-power laser so that the system will be very huge and harmful to the eyes. Alternatively, the time-correlated single photo-counting(TCSPC) technique has emerged as a candidate technology for lidar systems due to its high-sensitivity and excellent range resolution. The use of high-sensitivity single-photon detectors means that low average optical power levels and receive aperture can be used, even at long distances. In this study, we propose a photo-counting lidar, which can install on the theodolite platform to real-time obtain the distance and speed of a small moving target at long-rang. Methods: The light source of lidar is a fiber laser at 1545.3 nm, and the pulse width is 6 ns. The laser single pulse energy is 80 μJ, and the repetition frequency is 25 kHz. To track the small moving target more easily and steadily, the divergence angle of the laser beam and receiver field of view is set to 1.0 and 1.2 mrad, respectively. The InGaAs/InP avalanche photodiodes, which is Peltier cooled to 240 K, is adopted as the single-photon detector. The detection efficiency is 15% at 1545 nm, and the dark count rate is 30 kHz. A 1 nm bandpass fitter is selected to reduce the solar background noise. The lidar export a distance of the target by accumulating every 250-laser echo signal collected using the field-programmable gate array(FPGA) with a sampling rate of 400 MHz. Thus, the distance update rate is 100 Hz. However, the laser pulse width is wider than the echo signal-sampling resolution. Therefore, a Gaussian-fitting method is used to deal with the accumulated echo signal so that it can find the exact target distance. During the outfield test, a 0.99 reflectivity square target plate with a side length of 25 cm is designed so that it can be equivalent to a small target with a reflection cross-sectional area of 0.1 m2 and reflectivity of 0.6. The target plate is placed in five places with a known distance. The accuracy and precision of lidar are tested using lidar to range the five targets. Afterward, the target plate is placed 5 km away to test the lidar maximum range. Finally, the non-cooperative moving target ranging ability of the lidar is verified, the lidar system is installed on the theodolite platform for tracking and ranging a moving UAV fabricated by DJI corporation. The unscented Kalman filter algorithm is used to obtain the distance and velocity of UAV in real-time. Results and Discussions: During the entire outside experiment, the atmospheric visibility is 7 km. The target plate is detected at a distance of 5017.56 m(Fig.5) with the detected single-to-noise(SNR) of 5.86 dB. The precision is 0.165 m. The laser power is 1.42 W with a maximum power of 2 W. The maximum range is 5446.3 m through the extinction method. The lidar accuracy is 0.161 m when the detected SNR is around 6 dB(Table 2). Besides, the lidar system has tracked the moving UAV with a starting distance of 972.53 m(Fig. 8(a)). The laser power is 0.625 W, and the detected SNR is 20.2 dB during the tracing experiment. The Gaussian-fitting result showes that the distance is jittered so that it cannot calculate the velocity in real-time(Fig.8(b)). Thus, the polynomial fitting approach is used to smooth the distance obtained from a Gaussian-fitting method so that the speed of UAV can be precisely calculated by differentiating the polynomial fitting result(Figs. 8(c) and(d)). The distance and speed of the UAV are obtained using the unscented Kalman filter algorithm in real-time(Fig.9(a) and(c)). The unscented Kalman filter algorithm result, compared to the polynomial fitting approach, showes that the ranging deviation is within 0.11 m(Fig.9(b)), and the speed deviation is within 0.5 m/s(Fig.9(d)). Conclusions: A miniature lidar is designed, which is suitable for high-speed ranging of long-distance non-cooperative small targets. The theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the laser ranging system can achieve a maximum-detecting distance of 5446.3 m and an accuracy of 0.161 m for a small target with a reflection cross-sectional area of 0.1 m2 and reflectivity of 0.6 when the atmospheric visibility is 7 km. The system is installed on the theodolite platform to track and range the moving UAV. The distance and velocity of the UAV are obtained using the unscented Kalman filter algorithm in real-time. The ranging and speed deviations are within 0.11 m and 0.5 m/s, respectively. The photo-counting lidar design and unscented Kalman filter algorithm proved to be feasible for small moving targets ranging. © 2021, Chinese Lasers Press. All right reserved.},

	abstract = {The inter-cell interference (ICI) problem in OFDMA wireless systems is a major impediment to attain high rates particularly for cell-edge users in reuse-1 systems. Using centralized resource allocation to combat ICI is not practical, particularly in heterogeneous networks (HetNets), as they require intensive signaling about interference and channel state information that may not always be practically available. The main contribution of this paper is devising efficient autonomous power allocation schemes such that the interference produced by each cell is below a certain limit. We develop two inter-cell interference coordination (ICIC) frameworks; the overall interference limit (OIL), and the interference limit per resource block (ILR). The first framework imposes an overall interference limit on each cell, while the second imposes different interference limits on different resource blocks in each cell. We propose a closed form solution, and an iterative solution for the OIL framework, and a closed form solution for the ILR framework which has an additional advantage of possible autonomous application at each terminal rather than at the base station. We present two semi-autonomous heuristic and optimal adaptive schemes that use the overload indicator (OI) signal in LTE to adjust the values of the interference limits in the ILR scheme. They attempt to alleviate the interference seen by overloaded cells in order to achieve fairness among different cells, which is very important especially in HetNets. A method based on the Kalman filter is introduced to predict the values of the OI in the intervals between the OI exchanges. This estimation can be applied to the adaptive schemes almost autonomously as it requires very infrequent signaling between cells. Simulations show that the proposed schemes exhibit better performance than equal power allocation. Comparison with centralized optimal allocation that uses global information shows good performance with acceptable degradation in the spectral efficiency which decreases as the interference limit increases. Simulations also show that the ILR and the OIL schemes almost have the same performance, and the adaptive schemes achieve fairness among different cells especially in a HetNet environment. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a concept for hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) drive train control of a 10 MW full-scale ground test facility for wind energy converters(WEC). This is to enable realistic emulation of the missing rotor torque, in order to provide a realistic test environment under load conditions comparable to those in the field. The HiL framework consists of a dynamic rotor model coupled with the test rig drive train in a suitable structure. The goal is to apply a realistic torque on the main shaft of a device under test being comparable to that of an ideal WEC model. Therefore, accurate reproduction of the torque with respect to its dynamic and steady-state properties is required. Consequently, active vibration damping of the drive train is necessary due to the discrete mass structure of the drive train and finite elasticity of the intermediate couplings, and also enough degrees of freedom is required to influence frequency response of the closed-loop system in and around the torsional modes. Hence, the drive train has been modelled and an estimation-based torque control strategy has been proposed taking into account torsional behaviour of the drive train and the virtual rotor. In the proposed state-space control structure, a linear-quadratic-Gaussian regulator and a constrained model predictive controller (MPC) explicitly considering the actuator's physical limitation have been implemented, while the unmeasured state-variables are to provided by a time-varying Kalman filter. For an evaluation of the proposed approach, simulation results are provided and compared. Additionally, interaction of the coupled dynamic subsystems is analysed and illustrative conclusions are made. Overall, the proposed HiL framework leads to an accurate rotor inertia emulation and enables reproduction of the virtual rotor's torsional mode. © 2016 EUCA.},

	abstract = {Objective High sensitivity, large dynamic range, and anti-electromagnetism interference are advantages of interferometric fiber-optic hydrophones. In the fields of marine resources exploration and seabed geological exploration, it has a good application potential. Phase generated carrier (PGC) modulation and demodulation technology have the advantages of high sensitivity, easy multiplexing, and good linearity. Interferometric optical fiber hydrophones commonly employ this signal detection technology. PGC demodulation approach includes internal and external modulation. PGC demodulation results can be affected by laser intensity modulation and laser phase excursion caused by directly modulating laser, fluctuations in direct-current laser intensity, alternating-current laser intensity, phase modulation depth, and phase delay due to laser transmission delay, circuit transmission delay, etc. Several viable approaches to eliminating these factors' influence have been researched by numerous previous studies. However, most of them only focus on some of the abovementioned nonlinear factors and one case of PGC internal or external modulation. We hope to propose an approach to eliminate the effects of the abovementioned nonlinear factors. Furthermore, we hope that this approach can be employed in both PGC internal and external modulations. Methods To eliminate these effects, a PGC demodulation approach based on extended Kalman filter parameter estimation (PGC-EKF) is proposed in this study. The traditional PGC demodulation process is modified in this study using the characteristics of the PGC demodulation model that considers the influence of nonlinear factors. In the modified PGC demodulation process, the PGC demodulation problem can be transformed into the estimation of four demodulation model parameters D, Ex/Ey, sin(θx- θy) and cos(θx - θy). In this study, an ellipse fitting algorithm based on an extended Kalman particle filter is introduced to estimate the model' s parameters. An ellipse fitting algorithm can be employed to map the four demodulation model parameters into five elliptic equation coefficients a, b, c, d, and e to obtain the four demodulation model parameters. Furthermore, the EKF algorithm is employed to estimate the elliptic equation coefficients. After obtaining the five elliptic equation coefficients, we use the undetermined coefficient approach to obtain the mapping from the five elliptic equation coefficients a, b, c, d, and e to the four demodulation model parameters D, Ex/Ey, sin(θx - θy) and cos(θx - θy). The existing relational expression between the coefficients of the general equation of an ellipse and the parameters in its corresponding parameter equation is simplified using the undetermined coefficient approach, the incorrect part of the existing derivation results is corrected, and further derivation is performed in combination with the model's characteristics used in this study. After obtaining the demodulation model parameters, the acoustic signal to be measured can be obtained using the PGC arctangent (PGC-Atan) approach. Results and Discussions The simulation experiment is conducted under the conditions that the acoustic signal' s frequency to be measured is 500 Hz, the sampling frequency is 250 kHz, and the carrier frequency is 25 kHz. The simulation experimental results show that the EKF-based ellipse fitting estimation algorithm fits the estimation result curves of the four demodulation model parameters well with the actual values set in the simulation and can track the fluctuations of the four demodulation model parameters well (Fig. 4). The relative estimation errors of estimation results of four types of demodulation model parameters D, Ex/Ey, sin(θx - θy) and cos(θx - θy) are 0.07%, 0.39%, 0.59%, and 0. 28%, respectively (Table 2). The mean square errors of the estimation results of four types of demodulation model parameters A Ex/Ey, sin(θx -θy), and cos(θx -θy) are 1.00 × 10-10, 3.80 × 10-9, 5.70 × 10 - 10, and 2. 69 × 10-10 (Table 2). The experiment is conducted under the conditions that the laser' s center wavelength is 1550 nm, the linewidth is 1.9 kHz, the output power is 15 mW, the acoustic signal's frequency to be measured is 100 Hz, the sampling frequency is 500 kHz, and the carrier frequency is 31. 25 kHz. The experimental findings are as follows: the signal demodulated directly according to the traditional PGC-Atan approach has significant waveform distortion and AC interference, which is reflected in the spectral lines of low-frequency and high-order harmonic components with high intensity in its frequency spectrum (Fig. 10). The waveform distortion and AC interference in the time domain are suppressed in the PGC-EKF approach' s demodulation results proposed in this study, and the intensity of the low-frequency component and high-order harmonic component in the corresponding frequency spectrum is considerably reduced (Fig. 12). In the PGC-Atan approach, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), total harmonic distortion (THD), and signal-to-noise and distortion (SINAD) of the demodulation results are 21. 29 dB, - 9. 56 dB, and 9. 28 dB, respectively (Table 4). Additionally, in the PGC-EKF approach, the SNR, THD, and SINAD of the demodulation results are 30.13 dB, -28.81 dB, and 26.44 dB, respectively (Table 4). The SNR, THD, and SINAD of the PGC-EKF approach's demodulation results are better than those of the PGC-Atan approach. Conclusions In this study, the traditional PGC demodulation process is modified to eliminate the effects of laser intensity modulation, laser phase excursion, fluctuations in DC laser intensity, AC laser intensity, phase modulation depth, and phase delay on PGC demodulation results. An ellipse fitting algorithm based on EKF parameter estimation is applied to the modified demodulation model, and a PGC demodulation approach based on EKF parameter estimation is proposed in this study, which can be used for both PGC internal and external modulations. The existing relational expression between the coefficients of the general equation of an ellipse and the parameters in its corresponding parameter equation is simplified, the incorrect part of the existing derivation results is corrected, and further derivation is performed in combination with the model' s characteristics employed in this study. The experimental results show that the PGC-EKF approach proposed in this study improves the demodulation results' SNR by 8. 84 dB, reduces the THD by 19. 25 dB, enhances the SINAD by 17.16 dB, and significantly improves the system performance compared with the traditional PGC-Atan demodulation approach. This demonstrates that the PGC-EKF can efficiently demodulate the signal to be measured, suppress the AC interference and waveform distortion of the demodulated signal caused by the abovementioned nonlinear factors, and eliminate the low-frequency and high-order harmonic components in the demodulated signal frequency spectrum. © 2022 Science Press.

	abstract = {Millimetre-wave (mmWave) communication is subjected to different types of blockages. Nonline of sight (NLoS) is the key problem that is caused by blockage. This study aimed ayt predicting the occurrence of self-blockage, dynamic blockage and static blockage and performs hybrid beamforming. Self-blockage is addressed by selecting and alternating the optimal access point by using an enhanced artificial flora algorithm. The fitness value estimation for optimal selection is based on the signal-to-noise ratio, distance and elevation angle. A drone base station (BS) is used to overcome dynamic blockages by inferring the drone altitude from free space path loss, transmit power and number of ground users. Static blockage is avoided by selecting the nearest ground BS based on the measurement of the SNR value. For optimum matching, bipartite matching theory is used that matches UEs to more than one ground BS. It avoids the delay of UEs. Once the user is connected and starts to receive signals, hybrid beamforming of regularised channel diagonalisation with the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Kalman filter (KF) is applied to establish a communication beam. In hybrid beamforming the Channel State Information (CSI) is computed accurately by considering the frequency band, location, temperature, humidity, and weather which is performed by hybrid CNN with KF algorithm. Accurate CSI prediction ensures the formation of perfect beams from BSs and serves numerous users participating in the 5th Generation (5G) environment. The proposed system is implemented on a Matlab tool, and its performance is evaluated in terms of latency, blockage probability, number of users served, and spectral efficiency. © 2021, King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology.},

	abstract = {It is difficult to apply traditional modal analysis methods to structures with nonclassical damping or closely distributed modes, because the damping matrix is not diagonalized by the modal matrix obtained from the mass and stiffness matrices. In this paper, a new mode decomposition method for structures with nonclassical damping and very closely distributed modes is proposed. This method defines the generalized modes in state space and uses differential state variables constructed from measured acceleration responses to decompose modal responses. A Kalman filtering approach is utilized to calculate the linear transformation matrix of governing modes, and the linear transformation matrix is updated in the optimization process of the objective functions integrated with the power spectral density of a target mode. The two performance functions are proposed to maximize the energy at a certain mode and to minimize the differences between the decomposed modal power spectrum and averaged power spectrum, assuming that each mode has a monochromatic signature with one natural frequency and one damping ratio. To verify the proposed method, a numerical simulation is performed using a single degree of freedom system coupled with a tuned mass damper that represents a nonclassically damped system with closely distributed modes. The results from the simulations show that the proposed method estimates the modal responses more precisely than conventional mode decomposition methods such as the independent component analysis method.

The traditional scalar tracking loop (or scalar lock loop-SLL) tracks the satellite independently. There is no information exchange between each channel, which ignores the relationship between the receiver’s navigation (position and velocity) and the tracking loop information (code phase and Doppler frequency). The vector tracking loop take the advantage of this relationship, and combine the navigation filter with tracking loop in a Kalman filter, which improve the receiver’s anti-jamming ability and robustness. The simulation analyzes the influence on the tracking loop whether there has an interference, and this paper gives the comparison of position and velocity error.

	abstract = {This paper proposes a novel application for the optimal Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) servo controller to enable a proper coordination of the AC/HVDC interconnected system with Virtual Synchronous Power (VSP) based inertia emulation. Particularly, the proposed control design takes the process disturbances and measurement noise of the studied VSP-HVDC system into account, while few studies have focused on this perspective. The proposed LQG controller with modifications is designed by means of a combination of Kalman Filter (state estimator) and an added Linear Quadratic Integrator (LQI) to observe the system model's states and track the reference commands while rejecting the effects of system noise. Besides, we utilize a swarm-based optimization algorithm to operate as the search process for the tuning of the elements in the weighting matrices involved in the controller design. The role of the proposed optimal LQG controller is to stabilize such AC/DC interconnected system with VSP-based inertia emulator while minimizing the associated performance index. According to the obtained simulation results, in addition to the advancement from the VSP-based approach for damping frequency oscillations excited by faults, application of the proposed LQG servo controller can achieve the targets on both estimating the state variables and tracking the reference signals with satisfactory performance, comparing with the conventional LQG regulator. © 2021 The Author(s)},

These formulas are generalizations to MIMO systems of the well-known Ackermann formula used to design the control of systems with one input and many outputs (Single Input Multi Outputs System − SIMO). The approach is based on the transformations used in the original multi-step (multilevel) decomposition method, as well as a nondegenerate similarity transformation in the form of the Kalman controllability matrix. The obtained formulas are applicable to dynamic systems, for which the dimension of the state space is a multiple of the dimension of the inputs (controls). This limitation is removed by using the Yokoyama transform. These formulas differ in terms of parameterization of the set of equivalent laws. An example of the synthesis of a control law for a synchronous generator in a complex EPS is considered in order to preserve the existing modes of electromechanical oscillations and meet additional requirements (roughness with respect to disturbances and/or increased sensitivity to changes in controlled parameters in a given region or frequency band). © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.},

	abstract = {Radar is a non-contact monitoring tool for water flow monitoring, which is not affected by environmental factors, and has high measurement accuracy and long measurement distance. Therefore it has been widely used in recent years. At present, the radar hydrology survey mainly adopts a fixed mode. This way cannot meet the needs such as sudden floods and emergency rescue. In order to solve this problems, a water velocity and level monitoring based on UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) radar is proposed in this paper. The innovations of this paper are manifested in three aspects: 1) In order to overcome the influence of 1/f noise on the accuracy of current measurement, a scheme of shifting the frequency of the intermediate frequency signal outside the 1/f noise is proposed to improve the current measurement ability under weak signal conditions; 2) In order to overcome the unstable tilt angle of radar flow measurement caused by UAV jitter and wind force, the Kalman filter technology is used to estimate inclination angle for enhancing the flow measurement stability; 3) In order to overcome the influence of floating objects on the flow measurement accuracy, a multi-point flow measurement technology with spatio-temporal filtering is proposed to reduce the interference of floating objects. The experimental results show that the accuracy of the flow measurement in this paper is doubled compared with the traditional method, and the flow velocity range is doubled. The system has the advantages of small weight and low power consumption, and is suitable for flexible deployment of ordinary UAVs. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The radio-occultation observations taken by Tianwen-1 are aiming to study the properties of solar wind. A new method of frequency fluctuation (FF) estimation is presented for processing the down-link signals of Tianwen-1 during the occultation period to study the properties of the coronal plasma at the heliocentric distances of 4.48-19 R ⊙. Because of low S/N as well as the phase fluctuation phenomena caused by solar activity, a Kalman based on polynomial prediction methods is proposed to avoid the phase locked loop loss lock. A new detrend method based on multi-level iteration correction is proposed to estimate Doppler shift to get more accurate power density spectra of FF in the low frequency region. The data analyze procedure is used to get the properties of the solar corona during the occultation. The method was finally verified at the point when the solar offset is 5.7 R ⊙, frequency tracking was successfully performed on data with a carrier-to-noise ratio of about 28 dBHz. The density spectra obtained by the improved method are basically the same when the frequency is greater than 2 mHz, the uncertainty in the result of the rms of the FF obtained by removing the trend term with different order polynomials is less than 3.3%. The data without eliminating interference show a large error for different detrending orders, which justifies the need for an improved approach. Finally, the frequency fluctuation results combined with the information on intensity fluctuation obtained by the new method are compared with the results of the integrated Space Weather Analysis system and theoretical formula, which verifies that the processing results in this paper have a certain degree of credibility. © 2023.

	abstract = {Increasing technological progress in space technology is accompanied by an increased demand for accuracy. The alignment of optical instruments or antennas on the satellite platform requires structural stability that can no longer be achieved with traditional, passive methods, such as the use of materials with high stiffness or low coefficient of thermal expansion. Within the Infrared Astronomy Satellite Swarm Interferometry (IRASSI) project, an approach to actively stabilizing structures against low-frequency periodic heat induced deformations has been developed and simulated. In this study, the basic functionality of that thermomechanical FEM model is demonstrated by means of the thermal transfer functions between the changes in the applied heat and the resulting temperature changes, as well as a closed loop filter and controller approach consisting of a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) and a Kalman filter. For this purpose, an experimental setup consisting of an aluminum plate with 14 temperature sensors, four heating elements for controlling the structure and one heating element for simulating the perturbation is used. The evaluation of the thermal transfer functions in the model compared to the experimental setup shows a deviation of the phase shift of less than 0.6% and an amplitude shift of less than 3.5% on average. A Kalman filter processes the temperature measurement in order to obtain an optimal estimate for the LQR controller, which then calculates the necessary change in the heating power of the four control heating elements to minimize the displacements at the desired two positions in x- and y-direction. The verification is performed by a camera system as an external validation tool, which is able to resolve micron-scale displacements by measuring the spatial displacement of a speckle pattern applied to the structure using sub-pixel accurate image correlation algorithms. While the range of values of the amplitudes of the displacements is 8.93 μ in the uncontrolled case, an improvement of more than 4.6 dB could be achieved by applying the filter and controller system. Thus, it is demonstrated that this method has the potential to further improve already highly stable structures or to make lighter and cheaper materials with poorer passive stability values usable through active structural stabilization. © 2023 IAA},

	abstract = {In wireless communication, received signal strength indicator (RSSI) is a measurement of power in the received signal. This parameter is mainly used in radio frequency (RF) based distance estimation, position estimation, and handover mechanisms. In real-time applications such as object tracking, a handover mechanism, distance estimations require continuous reception of RSSI measurements in order to accurately estimate the position of the object. However, there are some constraints such as signal attenuation, signal loss, multi-path effects. These parameters cause variations in RSSI, and hence it becomes weak, which produces communication holes. Communication holes refer to the phenomenon when the signal drops to zero, and there is a communication blockage, which is practically negligible and can be considered as disconnection. This communication hole occurs due to various factors such as multi-path effects, noise, moving out of the coverage zone, device manufacturing faults, and inquiry procedure as well. The main focus of this paper is to address the issue of communication holes in Bluetooth networks. In Bluetooth networks communication holes also occur due to the delay in the inquiry procedure. Therefore, an existing gradient filter is modified based on the most recent measurements received. The proposed extended gradient filter is tested using simulated and real time RSSI measurements and compared with Kalman Filter and Kalman Smoother. The results show better performance in case of communication holes occurrence. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

A dynamically positioned shuttle tanker with six thrusters (three tunnel thrusters, two azimuth thrusters, and one main propeller with a rudder), operated in deep water condition was considered. A conventional proportional-derivative control algorithm was adopted for the main feedback control algorithm to reduce the position error, and an anti-windup integral control algorithm was introduced to suppress the steady-state error in the dynamic positioning operation. A minimum power consumption algorithm, based on the Lagrange multiplier method, was utilised in the thrust allocation for the thruster systems. An extended Kalman filter was used in the experiment to separate the low-frequency motion from the measured vessel motion. A set of experiments and numerical analyses were conducted in this study under the same environmental conditions and with the same control methodology. The dynamic positioning operation results obtained by the experiments and numerical simulations were compared to evaluate the station-keeping performance of the dynamically positioned shuttle tanker. © 2021 Transactions of Famena.

Scalar control has always been inaccurate and gives poor dynamic performance due of the coupling between variables. Vector control by rotor flux orientation drives the machine analogous to a DC machine and offers good dynamic performance for a wide range of application. However, the dynamic performance is dependent over the precise measurement of rotor flux, torque and speed. Direct torque control (DTC) on the other hand reduces the complexity of speed measurement, but requires flux and torque estimation. In this paper, industrial benefits and problems of DTC method has been discussed and reviewed with the latest improved available solutions of such problems. The problem of real time flux estimation over wide range can be overcome by using sensorless control of IM. In this paper estimation techniques of flux magnitude and its position are also reviewed and presented. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Millimeter wave (mmWave) communication requires large antenna arrays to increase the capability of cellular networks of the fifth generation with good beam-forming gains and a substantial reduction in path losses for both transmitting and receiving terminals. As large antenna arrays require one radio frequency chain per antenna element, the fully digital beamforming technique results in high cost and high-power consumption, and it is therefore not feasible. However, in analog solutions, adaptive gain control cannot be used as it reduces the likelihood of advanced processing and contributes to poor efficiency. Hybrid schemes are possible exciting solutions that overcome the deficiencies of pure digital or analog beam forming. The following are the three key contributions of the proposed work: a typical link budget specification for target data rate 3.10 Gbps in downlink and 0.6 Gbps in uplink is provided, micro strip patch antenna with a single element is designed to operate at 28 GHz and then converted into a standard linear array and a Kalman-based hybrid analog/digital precoding is used with a downlink rate of 4.64 Gbps/cell and an uplink rate of 1.84 Gbps/cell in multi-user environments. And the influence of both base station (BS) and 5G User equipment (UEs) beam steering capability is also explored. From the simulation result, it is evident that the proposed work offers a substantial increase in spectral efficiency approximately 9.28 bps/Hz at 20 dB with 10 channel paths. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {In the field of airborne radar resource management, one of the most accessible solutions to enhance the power of modern radar system is to save target tracking time as much as possible. During the target tracking process, it is effective to utilize the prior knowledge of the radar cross section (RCS) of the target to save airborne radar resource. Since the target RCS is sensitive to frequency and attitude angle, it is difficult to predict the target RCS accurately. This paper proposes an effective way to save airborne radar time resource in the target tracking process by changing radiation frequency of airborne radar to tolerate certain RCS fluctuation. Firstly, based on the tolerable fluctuation range of the target RCS, this paper designs an effective search algorithm to minimize the frequency set while maximizing the average RCS within the limited fluctuation range. Secondly, the detection probability prediction phase is renewed by taking the RCS fluctuation into account in order to reduce the radar dwell time. Finally, by using interactive multiple model Kalman filter (IMMKF) algorithm, a target tracking procedure with the minimum dwell time prediction method is proposed. Simulation results show that the proposed method is effective. As for target tracking simulation of three different trajectories, the proposed method can save at best 81.35% more dwell time than the fixed frequency method.  © 2020 Zijian Wu et al.},

	abstract = {This article proposes a cognitive frequency diversity array (FDA) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) (FDA-MIMO) radar network (CFDA-MIMON) target discrimination and tracking algorithm under main-lobe deceptive trajectory interference. This algorithm can be divided into two stages: search-discrimination-initialization and cognitive target tracking. The first stage mainly uses the distribution characteristics of target and main-lobe deceptive trajectory interference on different radars to discriminate the target and interference in the radar network. A target state initialization strategy driven by G-pair measurements with large time interval is proposed for target tracking. In the second stage, a cognitive target tracking algorithm of single FDA-MIMO radar system is designed based on the criteria of maximum Capon power spectrum. In addition, in order to avoid the divergence problem of the extended Kalman filter, a target state correction method based on auxiliary particles is proposed. Finally, the fusion strategy of multiple radar trajectories is used to alleviate the estimation error of the single radar. Numerical experiments verify that the proposed CFDA-MIMON target discrimination and tracking algorithm can distinguish the target from main-lobe deceptive trajectory interference without prior information of the target, and output the target's trajectory.  © 1965-2011 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Laser interception technique is a precision measurement technology which takes advantage of laser interferometry to detect weak vibrations caused by acoustic excitation with high precision. It has been greatly valued by national intelligence agencies, with pervasive application to counter-terrorism, crime investigation and other national security and defense affairs in various countries. This paper proposes an interception scheme based on acousto-optic frequency shifting laser self-mixing interferometry. In the case of weak light, the vibration information of the target object could be acquired in real time with high precision. And it is applicable for the development of miniaturized laser interception equipment. We use self-developed acousto-optic frequency shifters to stabilize the heterodyne frequency of the two laser beams at kHz level and heterodyne beat signal as carrier signal for micro-displacement detection. Besides, the self-balanced detection technology is applied to eliminate the common-mode noise of detection system, so as to ensure the signal-to-noise ratio of weak signal detection at nano-watt-level of laser power under long-distance interception conditions. By means of modulation phase recovery technique, combined with cavity frequency modulation method, Fourier transform phase extraction principle and Kalman filter method, the program realizes high-precision recovery of self-mixing interferometric displacement under weak feedback conditions and can effectively suppress low-frequency noise of laser source. © 2018 SPIE.},

	abstract = {In the case of one phase failure, the switched reluctance motor (SRM) will behave nearly the same, both in open circuit and in short circuit failure. This means, that the machine will understand the two faults in the same way which makes the SRM faults detection and diagnosis a more challenging task. This paper presents a diagnosis method based on pattern recognition analysis to detect and to classify automatically the electrical faults, short-and open-circuit under any level of load of the studied system: redundant three-phase power converter fed 6/4 SRM. The phases making a pattern recognition diagnosis of SRM, the training and the decision. The training phase consists in determining the pattern vector and the optimal kernels design (the separating classes) by Time-Frequency Representation (TFR). The training data is carried out using a set of fault scenarios, between healthy, single and combined faults, in terms of torque measurement at different load level, in order to deduce the fault severity. The second phase, consists in associating an unknown pattern with one of the defined classes, according to the "k-nearest neighbors" (knn) decision rule, associated with Kalman estimator to tracking of various operating modes and to predict the evolution of the call out of the knowledge database for a given operating mode in order to realize a preventive maintenance.

	abstract = {Taking advantage of the proliferation of optical wireless communications, this paper proposes a new paradigm of optical scattering (or ultraviolet) vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication with experimental analysis based on extensive channel measurements at a wavelength of 266 nm. This new optical scattering-based V2V technology can ease a fundamental requirement of pointing, acquisition, and tracking (PAT) commonly found in conventional optical V2V systems and can also provide an additional robust capability of efficient non-line-of-sight (NLOS) V2V transmission. Based on the experiments, it is demonstrated that in a mobile V2V channel where the dynamics are changing rapidly, the scattering of the UV photons in the upper atmosphere produces some unique characteristics, resulting in greater randomness and severe fading. From the experimental results, we characterize the channel by a non-stationary time-frequency-selective fading channel with a statistical description of the time-frequency-varying power profile. An examination of the measured data reveals that the distribution of the fading statistics follows the Rayleigh distribution but a departure from the Rayleigh distribution is also observed. In addition, to facilitate the real-time capture of the dynamic behavior of the UV-based V2V channel, a Kalman filter-based algorithm is presented to estimate the time-varying optical scattering channel parameters. Finally, some open issues and challenges in the optical scattering-based V2V technology are presented. IEEE},

	abstract = {The rapid development of wireless communication technology makes Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) technology and Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) technology, key candidates for the next generation mobile communication system. OFDM system has high frequency utilization and effectively resists multipath and narrowband interference. MIMO technology can effectively improve system capacity and system separation. This paper presents a hybrid Linear-Quadratic Estimation (LQE) technique for Channel Estimation in MIMO-OFDM system. In channel estimation, the noise covariance matrix (Q) plays a key role. In general, the value of Q depends on the previous state values. In a dynamic system, the previous values are not always known. The proposed hybrid model uses two techniques to address this issue. When the previous state values are known, Fast Adaptive Hybrid - Linear Quadratic Estimation (FAH-LQE) is used and when the previous state values are unknown Discrete Multivariate Hybrid - Linear Quadratic Estimation (DMH-LQE) is used. This enables the channel estimation to perform effectively in both scenarios. The FAH-LQE method uses covariance channel noise estimation equations and updates the threshold limit. DMH-LQE finds previous values using discrete generate matrix. The switching between FAH-LQE and DMH-LQE, based on the availability of previous state values, has increased the performance of the system effectively. The proposed algorithm produced lower BER values. For a mobility of 55km/h at SNR 15, BER values of proposed algorithm are 22%, 10%, 7%, 6%, and 3% lower than existing methods namely CE with and without EEP-Kalman tracking, perfect channel estimation, FAH-LQE, and DMH-LQE respectively. Similarly for a mobility of 115km/h at SNR 15, BER values of the proposed algorithm are 45%, 35%, 20%, 15% and 5% lower than above mentioned existing methods namely CE with and without EEP-Kalman tracking, perfect channel estimation, FAH-LQE, and DMH-LQE respectively. The SER has been reduced by 5% when no compensation method is applied. By using the proposed method, the Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR) has also reduced. © 2021, International Journal of Intelligent Engineering and Systems. All Rights Reserved.},

	abstract = {Microwave space-geodetic observations such as Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) or Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) are delayed in the neutral atmosphere. In order to improve the quality of these techniques for precise applications like reference frame realisation, we need to get more knowledge about the temporal and spatial refractivity variations in the neutrosphere. In addition to the annually to hourly long periodic variations, which can be considered within the adjustment process, micro-scale meteorological phenomena in the range of minutes to sub-seconds affect space-geodetic observations as well. Thus, induced phase fluctuations of wavefronts passing through the turbulent medium form a significant error source for electromagnetic wave propagation.In order to identify high-frequency atmospheric effects, we analysed 1 Hz high-rate GPS observations from the continuous operating GNSS station at the Geodetic Observatory Wettzell and derived post-fit carrier phase residuals for several days with a Kalman-Filter based Precise Point Positioning (PPP) approach. Since undifferenced carrier phase observations contain a superposition of several effects, the computed power-law behaviour of the residuals might not follow the theoretically predicted stochastical behaviour for refractivity fluctuations. Hence, the influence of multipath was identified. A residual stacking was performed, and the reduced residuals were analysed with regard to turbulence characteristics. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

	abstract = {Despite significant advances in adult clinical electrocardiography (ECG) signal processing techniques and the power of digital processors, the analysis of non-invasive foetal ECG (NI-FECG) is still in its infancy. The Physionet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2013 addresses some of these limitations by making a set of FECG data publicly available to the scientific community for evaluation of signal processing techniques. The abdominal ECG signals were first preprocessed with a band-pass filter in order to remove higher frequencies and baseline wander. A notch filter to remove power interferences at 50Hz or 60Hz was applied if required. The signals were then normalized before applying various source separation techniques to cancel the maternal ECG. These techniques included: template subtraction, principal/independent component analysis, extended Kalman filter and a combination of a subset of these methods (FUSE method). Foetal QRS detection was performed on all residuals using a Pan and Tompkins QRS detector and the residual channel with the smoothest foetal heart rate time series was selected. The FUSE algorithm performed better than all the individual methods on the training data set. On the validation and test sets, the best Challenge scores obtained were E1 = 179.44, E2 = 20.79, E3 = 153.07, E4 = 29.62 and E5 = 4.67 for events 1-5 respectively using the FUSE method. These were the best Challenge scores for E1 and E2 and third and second best Challenge scores for E3, E4 and E5 out of the 53 international teams that entered the Challenge. The results demonstrated that existing standard approaches for foetal heart rate estimation can be improved by fusing estimators together.

	abstract = {Increasing technological progress in space technology is accompanied by an increased demand for accuracy. The alignment of optical instruments or antennas on the satellite platform requires structural stability that can no longer be achieved with traditional, passive methods, such as the use of materials with high stiffness or low coefficient of thermal expansion. Within the Infrared Astronomy Satellite Swarm Interferometry (IRASSI) project, an approach to actively stabilizing structures against low-frequency periodic heat induced deformations has been developed and simulated. In this study, the basic functionality of that thermomechanical FEM model is demonstrated by means of the thermal transfer functions between the changes in the applied heat and the resulting temperature changes, as well as a closed loop filter and controller approach consisting of a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) and a Kalman filter. For this purpose, an experimental setup consisting of an aluminum plate with 14 temperature sensors, four heating elements for controlling the structure and one heating element for simulating the perturbation is used. The evaluation of the thermal transfer functions in the model compared to the experimental setup shows a deviation of the phase shift of less than 0.6 % and an amplitude shift of less than 3.5 % on average. A Kalman filter processes the temperature measurement in order to obtain an optimal estimate for the LQR controller, which then calculates the necessary change in the heating power of the four control heating elements to minimize the displacements at the desired two positions in x- and y-direction. The verification is performed by a camera system as an external validation tool, which is able to resolve micron-scale displacements by measuring the spatial displacement of a speckle pattern applied to the structure using sub-pixel accurate image correlation algorithms. While the range of values of the amplitudes of the displacements is 8.93 µm in the uncontrolled case, an improvement of more than 4.6 dB could be achieved by applying the filter and controller system. Thus, it is demonstrated that this method has the potential to further improve already highly stable structures or to make lighter and cheaper materials with poorer passive stability values usable through active structural stabilization.

The strategy is based on the communication network in an islanded microgrid, which is able to achieve minimal generation cost, reliable communication, and stable voltage and frequency. These targets are achieved through the following methods. Firstly, a power regulation part is combined with droop controller to constitute an improved primary control, which can take the line loss factor into account and adjust the output power of each distributed energy resource to its optimal value. Secondly, an optimal path reconstruction method and a Kalman filter estimation method with sliding mode controller are developed to address the communication interruption problem in communication channels and output channels, respectively. In the end, the secondary controller is used to regulate voltage and frequency, and a small signal model method is applied to analyze the impact on the whole system when these designs are applied.

	abstract = {A receiver with perfect channel state information (CSI) in a point-to-point multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel can compute the transmit beamforming vector that maximizes the transmission rate. For frequency-division duplex, a transmitter is not able to estimate CSI directly and has to obtain a quantized transmit beamforming vector from the receiver via a rate-limited feedback channel. We assume that time evolution of MIMO channels is modeled as a Gauss-Markov process parameterized by a temporal-correlation coefficient. Since feedback rate is usually low, we assume rank-one transmit beamforming or transmission with single data stream. For given feedback rate, we analyze the optimal feedback interval that maximizes the average received power of the systems with two transmit or two receive antennas. For other system sizes, the optimal feedback interval is approximated by maximizing the rate difference in a large system limit. Numerical results show that the large system approximation can predict the optimal interval for finite-size system quite accurately. Numerical results also show that quantizing transmit beamforming with the optimal feedback interval gives larger rate than the existing Kalman-filter scheme does by as much as 10% and then feeding back for every block does by 44% when the number of feedback bits is small. © 1972-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Real-time breath gas analysis with high accuracy, precision and time resolution, as a promising, non-invasive, fast and reliable tool, is important in medical diagnostics. Especially stable isotopologues of carbon dioxide is applied to multiple research areas including the diagnosis of gastrointestinal diseases. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is one of the most frequent bacterial infectious diseases in human beings and is now recognized as one of the key risk factors for chronic gastritis, peptic ulcers, stomach cancer and lymphoma. In contrast to traditional invasive tests, the most reliable non-invasive method in the diagnosis of the H. pylori infection is considered to be 13C-urea breath test which is implemented by measuring the 13CO2/12CO2 isotope ratio in human breath. Tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS) has the advantages of fast response, low drift, good gas selectivity and high detection sensitivity, and it is very convenient to develop a high precision, real-time and online measurement system. A precision laser spectrometer for the measurement of CO2 isotope abundance in human breath (with CO2 concentration of 4%-5%) or high concentration gas is designed and evaluated based on TDLAS technology. The spectrometer contains a novel compact dense-pattern multipass cell with a small volume of 280 cm3 and an effective optical path length of 26.4 m. The cell is in conjunction with a fiber-coupled distributed feedback diode laser operating at 2.008 μm. Wavelength modulation spectroscopy approach is used. The mass flow, pressure and temperature of the cell are actively controlled, and able to keep long-term stability. The influence of laser power fluctuation is eliminated by fitting the baseline with cubic polynomial to normalize the raw spectrum. Moving window regression is used to remove the influence of frequency drift on measuring isotope abundance. The system measurement precision is improved by wavelet denosing and Kalman filtering. The experimental results demonstrate that moving window regression method not only extends the stability time of the system but also improves the measurement precision of isotope abundance well, the wavelet denoising improves the signal-to-noise ratio by 2 times that by the method of multi-spectral average, the stability time of the system is 100 s given by Allan variance, and the measurement precision of CO2 isotope ratio is 0.067‰ after Kalman filtering. The use of small multi-pass cell and the default of denoising devices make the system more portable and improve the real-time and online measurement performance of the system. In addition to the measurement of 13CO2/12CO2 isotope ratio in human breath, by replacing different lasers, the spectrometer can also be used to measure trace gas concentration and the stable isotope abundance of many gas molecules in atmosphere. Therefore, the spectrometer will have broad applications in the areas of medical diagnosis, carbon cycle study and environmental monitoring. © 2017, Editorial Board of Nuclear Electronics & Detection Tech.

	abstract = {Soft wearable exoskeletons are a new approach for the applications of power assistance and rehabilitation training. In the present work, a neural-network-enhanced torque estimation controller (NNETEC) is proposed for a soft wearable elbow assistance exoskeleton with compliant tendon-sheath actuator. A comprehensive overview for the major components of the soft exoskeleton is introduced. The locations of anchor points are optimized via the maximum-stiffness principle. The NNETEC strategy is developed by fusing the feedback signals from surface electromyography (sEMG) sensors, inertial measurement units, force sensors, and motor encoder. It consists of a joint torque estimation module to identify the elbow torque of wearer based on Kalman filter, a neural-network adjustment module to recognize human motion intention, and a proportional-integral-derivative controller with hybrid position/torque feedbacks. Further experimental investigations are carried out by five volunteers to validate the effectiveness of the proposed soft elbow exoskeleton and control strategy. The results of the dumbbell-lifting experiments with various weights and frequencies demonstrate that, when compared with the proportional control strategy and the sEMG-based assistive control strategy without neural-network adjustment, the developed NNETEC method can achieve higher power assistance efficiency. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Phasor estimation is crucial for monitoring and control of smart power systems. The classical signal processing method named Prony has been used for estimating the parameters of measured signals such as frequency, damping factor and phasor. To reduce the impact of noise on the parameters estimated by Prony, multi-channel Prony has been previously explored and presented in the literature. The basic approach for multi-channel Prony is a generalized solution, in which new rows are added to matrices for every channel. Since the generalized multi-channel Prony is time-consuming, a new method based on recursive solution is proposed in this paper to make it suitable for real-Time application. Here, several channels of one Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU) are used to estimate the phasor of current/voltage in a recursive pattern, in which the phasor is computed recursively over time based on previously calculated estimates and new measurements. The proposed method is compared with three other solutions for multi-channel Prony: A) data fusion which is based on the Kalman filter concept, b) an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), and c) a consensus update approach which is based on an iterative procedure. Simulation results demonstrate the ability of the proposed method for real-Time phasor estimation, both in terms of maintaining the accuracy and reducing computation time. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Input shaping is an Optimal Control feedforward strategy whose ability to define how and when a flexible dynamical system defined by Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) and computer controlled would move into its operative space, without command induced unwanted dynamics, has been exhaustively demonstrated. This work examines the issue of Embedded Internet of Things (IoT) Input Shaping with regard to real time control of multibody oscillatory systems whose dynamics are better described by differential algebraic equations (DAEs). An overhead crane hanging a double link multibody payload has been appointed as a benchmark case; it is a multibody, multimode system. This might be worst scenario to implement Input Shaping. The reasons can be found in the wide array of constraints that arise. Firstly, the reliability of the multibody model was tested on a Functional Mock-Up Interface (FMI) with the two link payload suspended from the trolley by comparing the experimental video tapping signals in time domain faced with the signals extracted from the multibody model. The FFTs of the simulated and the experimental signal contain the same frequency harmonics only with somewhat different power due to the real world light damping in the joints. The application of this approach may be extended to other cases i.e., the usefulness of mobile hydraulic cranes is limited because the payload is supported by an overhead cable under tension that allows oscillation to occur during crane motion. If the payload size is not negligible small when compared with the cable length may introduce an additional oscillatory mode that creates a multibody double pendulum. To give the insight into the double pendulum dynamics by Lagrangian methods two slender rods as payloads are analyzed dealing with the overhead crane and a composite revolute-revolute joint is proposed to model the cable of the hydraulic crane, both assumptions facilitates an affordable analysis. This allows developing a general study of this type of multibody payloads dynamics including its normal modes, modes ratios plus ranges of frequencies expected. Input Shapers were calculated for those multimodes of vibration by convolving Specified Insensitivity (SI) shapers for each mode plus a novel Direct SI-SI shaper well suited to reduce the computational requirements, i.e., the number of the shaper taps, to carry out the convolution sum in real time by the IoT device based on a single microcontroller working as the command generator. Several comparisons are presented for the shaped and unshaped responses using both the multibody model, the experimental FMI set-up and finally a real world hydraulic crane under slewing motion commanded by an analog Joystick connected by two RF modules 802.15.4 to the IoT device that carry out the convolution sum in real time.

The review aims to establish the state of the art of the subject and presents as a conclusion how the HMM has been used and which are the open issues that need deeper research or new development to get new insights. To achieve this aim, the PRISMA methodology is carried out on Web of Science, PubMed, and Scopus. Chapter Two focuses on developing processes that provide tools (including soft and hard, analog and digital technologies) to any type of population, to break the inequality gaps in the context of the 4th industrial revolution. Chapter Three provides an overview, applications and challenges of VLC ODFM (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing) systems. In Chapter Four, the authors propose a low-cost, simple, and durable IoT-based system for the following two purposes: 1) predicting crops suitable for a given piece of land based on the soil parameters, namely, soil potential of Hydrogen (pH) and soil temperature and 2) monitoring and automating some of the recurrent processes, i.e., adding fertilizer such as Nitrogen, Phosphorous, and Potassium (NPK) and irrigation of the land. Chapter Five focuses on the effect of noise on the dynamics of natural processes. Chapter Six presents a study regarding the contribution of inrush current to the occurrence of mechanical fatigue in windings of a power transformer and, consequently, the impact of that phenomenon on the equipment's lifetime. Chapter Seven presents a design for short circuit withstand capability of a transformer. The short circuit test is carried out to verify the integrity of short circuits developed when short circuit current flows through the transformer. In the final chapter, the problem of initial orientation of strapdown navigation system on a movable base is solved using inertial measurements under the most general assumptions about the nature of random angular motion of the base. The solution to the problem is obtained in the form of an extended Kalman filter. © 2022 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Objective The space-ground laser time transfer experiment using the laser ranging and laser timing payload equipped on the lunar orbiter scheduled to be launched in 2023 by the Chinese Academy of Sciences aims to evaluate the performance of the on-board atomic clock and study the high-accuracy time comparison technology and autonomous navigation technology in Earth-Moon space to support China’s manned lunar exploration project and other interstellar missions in the future. Compared with dedicated time transfer experiments such as Time Transfer by Laser Link (T2L2) and Atomic Clock Ensemble in Space (ACES), whose model is studied in the local geocentric frame of reference, the model for laser time transfer in Earth-Moon space needs to be represented in the solarsystem barycentric space-time frame of reference using the Barycentric Coordinate Time (TCB) or Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB) as the reference time scale. To ensure the smooth progress of the high-accuracy time comparison mission, a measurement model for laser time transfer in Earth-Moon space with an uncertainty of order 1 ns is developed. Methods The proposed model is represented in the Barycentric Celestial Reference System (BCRS) using TCB as the reference time scale. The numerical time ephemeris of the earth, TE405, which is calculated using NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) development ephemerides, was employed to achieve a transformation with a 0. 1 ns level accuracy between the Geocentric Coordinate Time (TCG) and TCB. Based on the IAU resolution B1. 5 (2000), the nominal trajectory of the lunar spacecraft was used to calculate the influence of the gravitational fields of celestial bodies in the solar system on the rate of the on-board atomic clock. The round-trip light time model of laser pulses with an accuracy of 10 ps level was deduced. We built the model of Shapiro time delay with an accuracy of better than 10 ps, and established center of mass correction model, geometric position correction model, system delay model. Finally, based on the engineering background of the lunar orbiter scheduled to be launched in 2023, factors such as the stochastic and deterministic clock errors, satellite visibility, echo rate setting, and discontinuity of observations were all considered when performing the data simulation using the proposed measurement model for laser time transfer. Results and Discussions The data generated by the proposed measurement model are paired to identify the triplets, analyzed and processed to estimate the time offset and frequency offset of the on-board clock. Random white noise is then superimposed onto the nominal trajectory of the satellite to generate the position of the satellite, which is not constrained by the dynamic model and is used for data processing, resulting in a 1σ error of 3300 ns in the calculation of the one-way light time. This drowns out the deterministic error of the on-board clock by half an hour (0.5 ns/s×1800 s=900 ns). Thus, during data preprocessing, instead of using the traditional observed minus computed (O-C) residuals method to remove the trend caused by the orbit, the effective echoes are directly extracted from the observations (Fig. 9, Fig. 10). Such a processing method results in a lower accuracy of frequency offset estimation (the estimation error is approximately 15%) and larger root mean square error (approximately 40 ns). The dynamic model will be introduced into the proposed data processing procedure to constrain the variation in the kinematic parameters, which will certainly reduce these errors. Moreover, the standard deviation of the time comparison is at the ns-level (Fig. 11, Fig. 12), indicating that the precision of our measurement model reaches this level. Conclusions In this study, a calculation error for the relativistic shift of approximately 1.1×10-16 was obtained by neglecting the 1/c4 term and influence of the gravitational field of celestial bodies, other than that of the sun, earth, and moon. Consequently, the accuracy of time transformation between the proper time and TCB is better than 3.5 ns within one year, and the calculation error of the Shapiro delay is less than 10 ps when only considering the gravitational fields of the sun and earth. Moreover, the light time model of the round-trip is deduced and the model error caused by neglecting the 1/c4 term is less than 20 ps. The clock error time histories are also generated from Allan variance or Hadamard variance profiles using two different methods, the power-law spectral density model and Kalman filter state function. Although the calculation time for the former is equal to approximately 10% of the latter, the noise characteristics generated by the latter are closer to the given index. The feasibility of the ns-level uncertainty of the proposed measurement model for use in the high-accuracy laser time comparison missions in Earth-Moon space is also verified. The proposed time transformations, clock error model, and light time model can also be used in other scenarios such as in the development of a high-precision and accurate measurement model for microwave time transfer in Earth-Moon space, and in laser asynchronous transponders in Earth-Moon space. © 2023 Science Press.

	abstract = {In the framework of the IGS real-time service (RTS), CNES is now proposing for research purposes a new open source implementation of its PPP client. This PPP client corresponds to the user part of the PPP-WIZARD (With Integer And Zero-Difference Ambiguity Resolution) demonstrator. The paper presents this new product in details. Its architecture is designed to be as flexible as possible. Core algorithms are implemented in a library, compatible with other open sources implementations like BNC and RTKLIB. The architecture allows easy replay mode processing as well as parallel processing of a network of receivers. The C++ language was chosen for the implementation to allow high-level programming while maintaining a good level of portability, even on embedded devices with low CPU power. Special attention has been paid to ensure rapid execution on all platforms. The paper also details the functional model. This model exploits the concept of undifferenced and uncombined measurements. It is compatible with the most the latest state of the art techniques, such as ambiguity resolution, fast reconvergence, gap bridging, seamless regional augmentation, GNSS centric. It fully exploits the possibilities of the State Space Representation promoted by the RTCM standard. The estimation process is based on an extended Kalman filter. The parameters of the filter, i.e. the state vector, which reflect the functional model, are described. The filter process is split in two phases, propagation and estimation, that are also described, with an emphasis on the state estimation process based on an accurate measurement model. A typical tuning of the filter is proposed. Ambiguity resolution is an important aspect of PPP. Our model is by construction compatible with zero-difference ambiguity resolution. Since the formulation is uncombined, it is not only compatible with dual-frequency systems, but also paves the way for triple-frequency ambiguity resolution and the faster convergence time it allows reaching. Another important aspect of a PPP client is its robustness: to do so, several advanced algorithms, such as standard RAIM, advanced RAIM and gap bridging are implemented. These algorithms are detailed and typical improvement results are shown. Doppler smoothing is also implemented in the tool. This feature is particularly useful for single frequency applications, where the positioning solution is highly dependent on the quality of pseudo-range measurements. It is shown that adding Doppler data improves the quality of the solution in such a configuration. This PPP implementation is compatible with regional augmentation, thanks to the use of a specific atmospheric interface. This interface includes zenithal tropospheric delay and slant ionosphere delay. It is shown that this information, obtained for example from a dense network, allows reaching centimeter accuracy in a few minutes The constellations currently supported are those broadcast by the IGS RTS service i.e. GPS and Glonass; there is an ongoing work to add Galileo and Beidou. Finally, results obtained with real data using various configurations are presented. These configurations include comparisons between single and dual frequency processing, standard or precise point positioning, and using global, regional or local atmospheric augmentation. The results show the typical performance that can be obtained using PPP technology in terms of convergence time and accuracy after convergence.},
