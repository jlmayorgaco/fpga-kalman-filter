	abstract = {Accurate local bus frequency is essential for power system frequency regulation provided by distributed energy sources, flexible loads, and among others. This paper proposes a robust frequency divider (RFD) for online bus frequency estimation. Our RFD is independent of the load models, and the knowledge of swing equation parameters, transmission line parameters, and local Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU) measurements at each generator terminal bus is sufficient. In addition, it is able to handle several types of data quality issues, such as measurement noise, gross measurement errors, cyberattacks, and measurement losses. Furthermore, the proposed RFD contains the decentralized estimation of local generator rotor speeds and the centralized bus frequency estimation, which resembles the structure of the decentralized/hierarchical control scheme. This enables RFD for very large-scale system applications. Specifically, we decouple each generator from the rest of the system by treating metered real power injection as inputs and the frequency measurements provided by PMU as outputs; then a robust unscented Kalman filter based dynamic state estimator is proposed for local generator rotor speed estimation; finally, these rotor speeds are transmitted to control center for bus frequency estimation. Numerical results carried out on the IEEE 39-bus and 145-bus systems demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. © 1969-2012 IEEE. 0885-8950 © 2017 IEEE.

	abstract = {Several controllers address Load Frequency Control (LFC) to minimize deviations in system frequency caused due to rapid disturbances in load demand and Renewable Energy Source (RES) penetration. However, large power systems' complexity and the significant frequency deviations observed often limit these controllers. In order to address these issues, a novel Cubature Kalman filter (CKF) and Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) based on combined state estimation and optimal control is proposed. LQR is an optimal controller that curbs the frequency deviations by calculating optimal feedback gain values. The CKF is a novel state estimator algorithm used to estimate the state variables by minimizing the error between actual and estimated states. The proposed control is tested on a small single-area power system and a large-scale power system based in Egypt. The results obtained are compared with the existing Extended Kalman filter (EKF) and LQR-based control, Virtual Synchronous Generator (VSG) based control, and conventional Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control with over and under frequency protection circuit (OUPFC). The efficacy of CKF-LQR is emphasized through the analysis of various simulation cases of the power system. The findings suggested that the proposed controller's performance was robust under frequency measurement noise, low inertia, sudden change in RES, and load switching. The outcome shows that the proposed control is robust and can effectively regulate the system frequency compared to the other controllers. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {This presentation will describe field experience in the implementation of the distributed state estimator. The distributed state estimator (or otherwise named the SuperCalibrator) extracts the dynamic real time model of an electric power system using phasor measurement unit (PMU) data (GPS-synchronized) and other SCADA data that are available in substations. The method utilizes frequency and rate of change of frequency data from the PMU as well as the voltage and current phasors. Such data are available in raw form, as time-stamped instantaneous values, or, in the case of voltages and currents, as computed phasor data at the system fundamental frequency. The methodology consists of fitting the available PMU and other measurements to the dynamic model of the system and therefore it is a dynamic distributed state estimator (DSE). Conceptually, the DSE is a filter that uses all available data to extract the transient swings of the system in real time. The distributed state estimator is in field demonstrations presently. One installation has been completed and three others are in progress. The involved utilities are USVI-WAPA, NYPA, PG&E and Southern Company. The paper will present the experiences with the field implementation of the distributed state estimator, performance data and representative results. © 2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new Extended Kalman filter-based method for the estimation of the rotor angular speed of a synchronous machine. The main utility of the estimated speed is in the power system stabilizer. The paper briefly reviews the problems associated with the existing methods for reliable and accurate rotor speed measurement or estimation. It is shown that the existing methods of rotor speed estimation have some severe drawbacks and may cause the power system stabilizer to operate suboptimal or even produce negative damping over a specific frequency range when an inaccurate rotor speed signal is used as the input to the power system stabilizer. Most importantly it demonstrates that a system equipped with it behaves as predicted in simulations, especially when examining inter-area modes. The new rotor speed estimation method was implemented on an industrial control platform and integrated in a modern digital excitation system. A series of hardware-in-the-loop simulations were run to examine the properties of the new speed estimator. The simulations confirm that the new speed offers superior performance in terms of speed estimation accuracy, which allows the proper damping of oscillations over a frequency range of interest. © 2014 IEEE.},

In this paper, we present a novel two-step framework to estimate these parameters for both single-phase and three-phase power systems including harmonics and interharmonics. After employing a harmonic version of the Aboutanios and Mulgrew (HAM) estimator, the fundamental frequency and phase estimates are further refined by a weighted least squares (WLS) estimator. The WLS refinement step takes advantage of the harmonic and interharmonic relationships to further improve the parameter estimation from the HAM step. Consequently, the proposed HAM-WLS method maintains accuracy even in electrically-noisy environments that are also contaminated with both harmonics and interharmonics. Results from both simulated and real data under various power system conditions verify that the HAM-WLS estimator outperforms state-of-the-art estimation methods in terms of accuracy, complexity and convergence. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Estimation of the parameters of the power generators are important part of a power system modeling and simulation. A reliable estimation of a synchronous generator parameters can be done using waveforms measured directly on the terminals of the machine. The waveforms are recorded during a carefully chosen disturbance tests of the generating unit. One of the quantities necessary to determine the generator parameters is the deviation of the generator angular speed. However, because of the safety reasons, it is very difficult to get access to the direct measurement of this quantity on a operating generating unit. Angular speed estimation based on a generator stator voltage seems to be an alternative solution to the problem. The aim of the paper is to find a computationally efficient and accurate method of indirect angular speed estimation of a synchronous generator which is based on the recording of its stator voltage during a load rejection test. The algorithms evaluated in the paper are based on Prony's estimator, zero-crossing detection, least-square data fitting and layer recurrent neural network. Paper contains literature survey, mathematical model of the considered generator, analysis of its stator voltage recorded in a power plant, description of the selected algorithms and results of the algorithms estimation using a signal with known frequency variation.

	abstract = {The control of grid-connected power converters, such as in photovoltaic generation systems, requires a fast, accurate, and robust synchronization method, particularly during faults and when operating under highly disturbed conditions. This paper presents a method to estimate the frequency, amplitude, and phase of the positive- and negative-sequence components. A filtering stage in a rotating reference frame based on a particular type of notch filter is designed to reject the most relevant disturbances, including voltage sags, frequency variations, phase jumps, voltage imbalances, and harmonics. Furthermore, an accurate estimation of the grid frequency is also carried out. Extensive simulation and experimental results are provided to show the performance of the estimation method in different scenarios considering the aforementioned disturbances. The method is able to precisely provide the estimated values between one and one and a half cycles of the fundamental frequency. Furthermore, the computational cost of implementation of the notch filters employed is considerably small. © 2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Inception of any disturbance may edge the power system towards transient unstable settings. To safeguard the system from transient instability, accurate and quick assessment of impact of disturbance on the system is essential. The majority of available state-of-art presents phasor measurement unit (PMU) assisted Transient Stability Assessment (TSA), which does not infer any information regarding the severity of disturbance on the system. This paper proposes model free Wide Area Transient Instability Severity Analyser (WATISA) for real-time severity assessment effectively. The WATISA presents first swing TSA in terms of severity assessments. Following an event, severity assessment is quantified by assessing the number of severely affected buses connected with generators and loads. The presented method first, utilizes synchronized bus frequency and voltage measurements to construct a novel Robust Severity Assessment Index (RSAI) to capture the real-time status of a power network. Then, to determine the severity of an event, Severity Indices (SI) based on RSAI and bus voltage measurements are calculated. Finally, Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) of decision estimators is developed to evaluate associated Severity Level (SL) for incurred disturbance. To validate robustness of the proposed WATISA, its performance is tested with system topological changes and wide-area measurement noise. The simulation results on IEEE 39 bus power system highlights method effectiveness in estimating severity level with topological changes and measurement noise. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Synchrophasor estimators are nowadays evaluated with the Total Vector Error (TVE) using the synchrophasor representations of the few benchmark signals. This synchrophasor dependence prevents its application to power signals of real events. A new method to obtain the synchrophasor of real signals is proposed in this paper. A finite impulse response (FIR) filter, designed with the nonic O-spline is proposed to obtain phasor estimates asymptotically close to those of an ideal bandpass filter. The phasor estimation accuracy of one or several Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) can be then assessed using the standard. In addition, it is possible to design two FIR differentiators to obtain frequency and ROCOF estimates close enough to those of ideal differentiator filters, and largely compliant with the standard. This new set of filters opens the way to apply the synchrophasor standard to assess estimates of PMUs of different brands when they process the same signals of a power system event. In this paper, the erratic phasor and frequency estimates produced by a SEL-351 A PMU from a real distributed generation system are assessed to corroborate that the synchrophasor standard can be opened to this new application based on real signals from the field, previously considered as impossible.  © 1986-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In multi-feeder microgrid systems, accurate power sharing and voltage regulation at each load feeder is more challenging than the conventional single-feeder microgrids. This paper presents an enhanced resilient control strategy for multi-feeder micro-network systems by considering the load feeder voltage regulation and power balancing as a quadratic optimization problem. The proposed control strategy is composed of impedance estimator and optimal controller. However, the impedance estimator obtains each load feeder impedance while optimal controller computes the voltage commands for each distributed generator. One of the important aspects of the proposed control scheme is that only the voltage magnitude information is required to transfer at each inverter's controller, with primary aim to achieve the two-fold objectives. This control strategy is also extended to approximate the whole network impedance into solitary load feeder for micro-networks with extensive number of load feeders. This makes the system computationally less burdening. The MATLAB/Simulink and experimental results are obtained under varying load conditions and line parameter uncertainties for radial type multi-feeder microgrid configuration that reflects the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. The verification outcomes prove the proposed method capability of accurate reactive power sharing, regulation of load feeder voltages, and frequency restoration. © 2022},

Fourier filter-based phasor estimation algorithms, which have been predominately used in phasor measurement units, have difficulties in processing dynamic sinusoidal waveform distortions, such as modulation, frequency drift, abrupt change in magnitude, etc. This paper proposes an adaptive approach for accurately estimating phasors while eliminating the effect of various transient disturbances on voltages and currents. The method preanalyzes the waveform spanning the window of observation to identify and localize the discontinuities which affect the accuracy of phasor computation. A quadratic polynomial signal model is used to improve the accuracy of phasor estimates during power oscillations. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the advantages. The method was implemented on a PC-based PXI system for real-time phasor computations. It can also be used as reference algorithm for testing the performance of the devices extracting synchronized phasor measurements. © 2012 IEEE.},

This paper proposes an adaptive mitigation scheme to damp the SSO for a full range of subsynchronous frequency variations due to different operating conditions. The proposed scheme comprises 1) a subsynchronous frequency estimator (SSFE) and 2) an adaptive subsynchronous damping controller (ASDC). The SSFE detects the SSO mode and tracks its subsynchronous frequency accurately. The ASDC utilizes voltage signals to extract the SSO at the estimated subsynchronous frequency, generates appropriate current signals, and injects them into the grid through a shunt-voltage sourced converter (SVSC). The ASDC behaves like a variable impedance, which essentially reshapes the system's impedance response by adding a positive resistance at the estimated subsynchronous frequency. The parameters of the phase-shifters are computed using Brent's root-finding method such that the desired phase-shift at the estimated subsynchronous frequency is always maintained. The control's adaptiveness and damping performance under different operating scenarios is verified through extensive EMT simulations on a real-world wind power system facing SSO using PSCAD. © 1986-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces a practical sensorless average current-programmed mode controller for low-power dc-dc converters operating at high switching frequencies. The controller accurately estimates inductor currents and identifies main converter parameters. Namely, total conduction losses in each of the phases as well as the inductors and output capacitance values are identified. The estimate of the losses is used to monitor temperature of the components without costly thermal sensors and for current sharing based on thermal stress equalization increasing system reliability. The identified filter values are utilized in a transient-mode controller for obtaining response with virtually minimum output voltage deviation. The key element of the new controller is a self-tuning digital multiparameter estimator that operates on the inductor time-constant matching principle. It estimates the average inductor current over one switching cycle using an adaptive IIR filter and, in the same process, identifies other converter parameters. The operation of the controller is verified with a single-phase 12 to 1.5 V, 15 W and a dual-phase 12 to 1.8 V, 80 W buck converter prototypes operating at 500 kHz switching frequency. The results show that the controller estimates the current and temperature of the components with better than 10% accuracy, effectively equalizes phase temperatures, and provides virtually minimum output voltage deviation during load transients. The implementation also shows that the controller is well suited for on-chip implementation. Its full realization requires less than 16000 logic gates and two relatively simple ADCs that, in a standard 0.18-μm CMOS process, can be implemented on a small silicon area, no larger than 0.6 mm 2. © 2006 IEEE.},

Monitoring SSOs is critical for setting up control strategies and mitigating SSOs effectively. In many SSO events, the oscillation frequency and magnitude are time-varying, which brings great challenges to SSO monitoring. This article proposes an adaptive-reset extended Kalman filter (AREKF) method for accurate estimation of SSO modes. Two improvements are made to the EKF method. The first one is establishing a four-state SSO signal model for the EKF algorithm to track damping factors of SSO modes. The second one is developing an adaptive-reset method to make the EKF algorithm capable of handling the time-varying SSOs by resetting the covariance matrix adaptively. The threshold in the adaptive-reset criterion is automatically tuned with the M2M4 estimator. The performance of the AREKF method is demonstrated under various conditions and compared with that of conventional KF-based and phase-locked loop-based methods. Simulation results validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method as well as its superiority over conventional approaches. Real-time experiment results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method in practical applications.  © 1986-2012 IEEE.},

Compared to the existing correlation-based method, the proposed CPD method is based on upon a maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for the detection of an unknown number changes in signal mean to unknown levels at unknown times. Using the pruned exact linear time (PELT) dynamic programming algorithm along with a novel refinement technique, the proposed approach is shown to provide a dramatic improvement in FO start/stop time estimation accuracy while being robust to intermittent FOs.

The correntropy term leads to better performance in estimating phasor and frequency under dynamic conditions of a power system both in Gaussian as well as impulsive noise environment. Additionally, some assumptions have been considered to compute the inverse Hessian matrix that optimizes memory resources and time consumption. In addition, the underlying sparse behaviour of the adaptive filter has been exploited through norm to significantly improve the accuracy and the convergence rate of the phasor estimation. Moreover, this work demonstrates the feasibility of implementing the new VCMC-ZARGN estimator in real time using the real-world measurement acquired from the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL) campus grid and also experimental setup based on the Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) with optimum device utilization that is authenticated using a PV-Wind hybrid system.  © 1986-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The power grids are becoming smarter with adoption of various IoT Technologies (Internet of Things). IoT calls for sensors, which are transacting real time data through communication channels, installed at various locations in power system. These communication channels not only become overloaded by high volume of state-estimation data from these sensors but are also prone to cyber-attacks. The cyber-attack may infirmly affect the load frequency control (LFC) schemes which are implemented across multi-area grids using state estimation techniques. The cyber-attack may modify system frequency via signal false data injections in system and therefore deteriorates system performance or may even lead to blackout. In this work, artificial intelligent (AI) estimator and nonlinear sliding mode controller (SMC) are combined together to form event-triggered intelligent control scheme which not only optimise the use of communication infrastructure but also attenuates cyber intrusions. The AI observer predicts grid states and also senses cyber intrusions via the back propagation error algorithm in presence of cyber-attacks. The proposed event-triggered SMC rejects the undesirable impact of cyber intrusions on the plant trajectories. The proposed event-triggered control strategy when subjected to cyber attack and power penetration from the distributed renewable resources is demonstrated through MATLAB simulations. IEEE},

	abstract = {The proliferation of inverter-based distributed energy resources (DER) makes the interfaced grid face a fast frequency response, and the resulted time-variant frequency features a considerable fluctuation that degrades the frequency stability. This frequency information can be estimated by the phase-locked loops/frequency-locked loops (PLLs/FLLs) embedded in the DER inverters, yet they are difficult to track this frequency and obtain its derivative quickly. This paper aims to tackle this problem. Firstly, a time-variant parameter model is proposed to reflect an accurate relationship between the frequency derivative and the input signal. Since the input signal is defined with ramp frequency, the given model overcomes the inherent time-invariant restriction of the well-known notch filter/model. Then, a nonlinear estimator is derived by the equality-constraint optimization to obtain the model's parameters. The nonlinear estimator avoids the slow convergence speed and biased time-variant parameter tracking induced by the linear estimation framework. The derived linearized model further proves that the proposed estimator can accurately track ramp frequency within 20 ms. Experimental tests under time-variant frequency disturbances verify the proposed estimator's faster and more accurate estimation performance than the commonly-used/recently published PLLs/FLLs. © 1969-2012 IEEE.},

Synchrophasor measurements, however, are applied in power systems to track dynamic conditions where, by definition, currents and voltages, though resembling sine-waves, exhibit changes in their magnitudes and vectorial positions. This paper presents a novel algorithm for estimating synchrophasors under such dynamic conditions. In contrast to the classical Fourier algorithm, our model is a complex Taylor expansion, yielding several parameters in the model to be estimated. Four- and six-parameter models are presented corresponding to first and second order Taylor expansions. This paper derives a compensation method for canceling the error in the classical Fourier algorithm that arises under dynamic conditions, shows comparative simulation and test results and describes an efficient implementation. Application of the error cancellation method to other phasor algorithms and extending the technique to higher order Taylor expansions, are discussed. Implementation of synchrophasor measurements on protection and control intelligent electronic devices (IEDs) is discussed, and solutions are presented that allow for secure integration. © 2007 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This study develops and compares several networked control and estimation algorithms to manipulate the power consumption of a population of residential thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs) to fulfill PJM frequency regulation requests given an imperfect communication network and modeling error. The algorithms rely on a model of the plant to reduce the effects of communication delays, and include a stochastic, predictive controller and two Kalman filter-based state estimation techniques. The first estimator uses a set of independent Kalman filters that run in parallel, and the second incorporates individual TCL models that rely on identified thermal parameters. We use simulations to examine 1) the algorithms' ability to adequately provide frequency regulation under a range of delay severities, and 2) the effect of increased modeling error. We find that both estimator-controller combinations provide acceptable frequency regulation with average delays of 20 s and minor modeling error. When we increase the modeling error by using a higher order model to represent the TCLs within the plant, the first estimator provides acceptable frequency regulation, whereas the second estimator provides poor frequency regulation. © 1969-2012 IEEE.},

Second, an analytical method based on the statistical behavior of the estimates obtained from the frequency domain system model solution is presented to address the multiple estimates problem, identifying the faulted section. The presented fault location physics-based analytical model considers the capacitive effect of distribution lines. Furthermore, voltages and currents measured from only one terminal are used. The formulation is evaluated using the IEEE 13-bus and a modified version of the IEEE 34-bus test feeders. Comparative analysis with state-of-the-art methods is presented. Average errors of 1.95% are obtained.

	abstract = {Grid-forming inverters, such as the virtual synchronous generator (VSG), can emulate constant or time-varying inertia to mitigate frequency stability issues. This paper proposes a data-driven variational Bayesian adaptive unscented Kalman filter (VBAUKF) to estimate the VSG-based inverter inertia and damping factor using its terminal measurements. By adopting the Thevenin equivalent idea, the virtual frequency of VSG is estimated first. Utilizing the estimated virtual frequency and considering the effects of the inverter current limiter, the time-varying inertia and damping factor estimation problem is reformulated into the state-space model-based dynamic state estimation framework. The measurements include the obtained virtual frequency, inverter terminal real, and reactive power while the unknowns are inverter inertia, damping factor, internal virtual rotor speed, and angle. To this end, an innovative VBAUKF is proposed with the advantages of dealing with unknown and time-varying models and measurement uncertainties. Numerical results on the modified IEEE 39-bus system and IEEE 118-bus power system demonstrate that the proposed estimator significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches under various scenarios.

	abstract = {With the increasing integration of PV generation in AC microgrids, it is challenging to keep the stability of system frequency due to the intermittent and stochastic nature of PVs. Thus, in order to reduce the investment and maintenance costs of storage systems, the electric utility has shown increasing interest in calling on PVs to provide frequency regulation services. In this paper, a novel sliding mode control (SMC) based adaptive power point tracking (APPT) control strategy is proposed to provide bi-directional primary frequency regulation (BPFR) of an AC microgrid. In this strategy, in order to restrain the variation of frequency, the sliding mode surface is adaptively regulated to provide an adaptive power reserve. Thus, the PVs will have a power headroom to regulate the frequency both up and down through releasing the reserved power or increasing the reserves of the PV systems. Furthermore, the sliding mode surface is adaptively regulated only based on the locally measured frequency of the microgrid without the requirements of communication, detailed PV model, irradiance sensors as well as MPP estimators. Thus, the proposed control strategy shows the advantages of easy to implement and reduces the investment and maintenance costs of installing storage systems or irradiance sensors.  © 1969-2012 IEEE.},

Moreover, the estimated value deviates farther from the theoretical value because of decaying DC components. New phasor estimators are proposed in this paper. They are able to handle the dynamic characteristics as well as the decaying DC components so as to improve the accuracy of phasor estimation. A new frequency estimator is proposed for this purpose. Two filters are employed to estimate the fundamental component and DC components, respectively. Then, least squares method (LSM) gives accurate estimation by reassigning the estimations obtained by short time Fourier transformation (STFT). The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated by computer-simulated signals, EMTDC-generated signals, and signals recorded by a commercial relay from real time digital simulator (RTDS). The evaluation results indicate that the proposed algorithms can achieve accurate phasor estimation, frequency estimation, and even power estimation in presence of frequency deviations and decaying DC components with a minimal increase of computational cost and time delay compared with the conventional STFT. © 2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {When the grounding fault occurs in power systems, it might stimulate power oscillations and generate decaying dc component (DDC) in the fault currents. Both will cause a sharp drop in the phasor monitoring accuracy of phasor measurement units (PMUs) and even lead operational protection devices to malfunction. Thus, a multiple-frequency-Taylor-model (MFTM)-based dynamic synchrophasor estimator considering DDC (MFTDC) is proposed to overcome the adverse effect by modeling dynamic behavior and DDC. Firstly, several sub-phasors extended by the Taylor series are employed to form the dynamic fundamental component and DDC. Secondly, rough phasor estimations are obtained by DFT filters at multiple frequency bins to establish the MFTDC equation set. Then, all Taylor derivatives of MFTDC can be solved by the least square method. Finally, various IEEE standard P-class test and static/dynamic-state DDC test results of computer, PSCAD/EMTDC, and RTDS-generated signals verify that MFTDC is suitable for the protection applications of power systems. It can yield more accurate phasor estimations of PMUs than that of our previous work and shorten the convergence time to 20.3 ms or less, especially under the dynamic-state DDC scenarios. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

Damped transients generated by the growing use of electronically controlled devices are an important source of harmonic distortion of voltage and current waveforms. Accurate real-time estimation of harmonics parameters during the on-line operation of some electric power system is thus an active and pertinent challenging research issue. In this paper a novel on-line algebraic parametric estimation method in time domain, for damped harmonic components on electric power system signals is introduced. Algebraic formulas to directly compute amplitude, damping, frequency and phase parameters and dc offset component into a small time window for variable multi-frequency oscillations are proposed. Parameter estimators enable the on-line and direct reconstruction in finite time of harmonic components and deviations of some measurable signal. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the algebraic parametric estimation on uncertain multi-frequency oscillating transient signals. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Grid-tied inverters are widely used in the modern power network. The span of their applications varies from power quality enhancement, uninterruptible power supply, grid interface to distributed energy sources, etc. A major aspect of controlling the grid-tied power converter is the synchronization with the main grid. A robust synchronization method is required to maintain the power injection during grid fault and highly distorted grid voltage. This paper introduces a novel Pseudo-Open Loop Synchronization Technique (POLS) based on a fixed reference frame estimator: the Fundamental Positive Components Estimator (PFCE). The algorithm will generate three unitary sinus waveform synchronized with the fundamental positive component of a three-phase grid voltage. Open Loop Synchronization (OLS) technique differs from the closed loop PLL in that it has a faster dynamics response. Two problems may face the OLS: a low-quality main voltage and frequency drift. To face the voltage quality problem, the PFCE is used. This choice is advantageous over the use of a low-pass filter due to the absence of the time delay and filtering performances. For the frequency drift, an optional simple frequency estimator is used. No trigonometric computation is required for the proposed algorithm, making it easy to implement on a low-cost microcontroller. The performances and effectiveness of the proposed method are demonstrated through simulation and experimental results. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

An estimation algorithm that can rapidly track the fast-changing frequency and phase by using quarter cycle samples are proposed. Specifically, the data model in the three-phase power system is first converted to the noise-corrupted single phase harmonic signal model by using the Clarke transformation. A new weighted least squares (WLS) parameter estimator, which refines the initial estimates from the standard estimation techniques, is computed by utilizing the harmonic structure of the signal. Since the initial estimates become unreliable with limited samples, we proposed an iterative algorithm to polish the initial estimates for WLS. Numerical results show that the proposed estimator outperforms the conventional estimators, especially in a data-limited case. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {A robust technique for online estimation of the fundamental frequency of both balanced and unbalanced three-phase power systems is proposed. This is achieved by introducing a widely linear least mean phase (WL-LMP) frequency estimator, based on Clarke's transformation and widely linear complex domain modelling. The proposed method makes use of the full second-order information within the complex-valued system voltage, making it possible to eliminate otherwise unavoidable oscillations in frequency estimation. In this way, the WL-LMP inherits the advantages of the phase-only approach, such as its high angle estimation accuracy and immunity to voltage and harmonics variations, while accounting for the noncircularity of Clarke's voltage in unbalanced conditions. Simulations over a range of unbalanced conditions, including those caused by voltage sags and higher order harmonics, and case studies for real-world unbalanced power systems support the analysis. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

It combines three algorithms with favorable asymptotic statistical properties: a periodogram-based iterative frequency estimator, a Discrete-Time Fourier Transform (DTFT)-based method of estimating amplitude and phase, and a changepoint detection (CPD) method for estimating the FO start and stop samples. Each of these have been shown in the literature to be approximate maximum likelihood estimators (MLE), meaning that for large enough sample size or signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), they can be unbiased and reach the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound in variance. The proposed method is shown through Monte Carlo simulations of a low-order model of the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) power system to achieve statistical efficiency for low SNR values. The proposed method is validated with data measured from the January 11, 2019 US Eastern Interconnection (EI) FO event. It is shown to accurately extract the FO parameters and remove electromechanical mode meter bias, even with a time-varying FO amplitude © 2023 IEEE.},

Without consideration of parasitics, the estimator is low-accurate, which affects system Small Signal Model (SSM) and degrades the control performance. In this paper, the issue is studied in frequency domain, and solved by a Corrective Frequency Compensation for Parasitics (CFCP) strategy. First, transfer functions for power converter, current estimator and current mode controller are given for frequency-domain analysis. Second, without consideration of parasitics, conventional proportional integral compensation is used to improve the system stability. Furthermore, with consideration of parasitics, converter main pole is replaced by two poles while a zero emerges at the origin. In order to cancel out the influence, the proposed CFCP strategy adopts a second-order transfer function to correct zero/pole variation induced by parasitics. Finally, steady state performance and transient response of the converter are improved, which are verified by simulations and experiments. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a fast and robust unscented Kalman filter based decentralized dynamic state estimator (DSE) for power system online monitoring and control. The proposed robust DSE is able to detect, identify, and suppress three types of outliers, namely the observation, innovation, and structural outliers. Observation outliers refer to the received PMU measurements providing unreliable metered values due to gross errors or cyber attacks; innovation outliers are typically caused by impulsive system process noise, whereas structural outliers are induced by incorrect parameters of the generators or its associated controllers, such as exciters and speed governors. To enable the fast estimation of generator states of large-scale power systems in a decentralized manner, two model decoupling approaches are presented and compared. It is shown that the generator decoupling approach presented in this paper achieves higher statistical efficiency than the ones proposed in the literature in the presence of both small and large measurement noise. To detect and distinguish three types of outliers, projection statistics based multiple hypothesis testing approach is proposed. Specifically, three hypotheses corresponding to the occurrence of three types of outliers are assumed by constructing three innovation matrices; these matrices are made up by time-correlated innovation vectors, and/or predicted states, and/or measurements; then projection statistics are applied to each of the innovation matrix and its calculated projection values are checked by a statistical test to validate the assumed hypothesis. The identified outliers are further suppressed by a generalized maximum-likelihood-type estimator. Numerical results carried out on the IEEE 39-bus system demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. © 1969-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new centralized adaptive underfrequency load shedding controller that is integrated with a distribution state estimator to improve the frequency stability of islanded microgrids. While underfrequency load shedding is a well-established corrective emergency frequency-control action, it is not entirely suitable for use in microgrids with low inertia and a limited number of measurement devices. The novel centralized controller presented in this paper overcomes these challenges by incorporating a distribution state estimator to estimate the power consumption of the demand. In parallel to this, the actual active power imbalance in the microgrid is estimated by simultaneously monitoring the system frequency and its rate of change. The centralized controller uses these two variables to determine the correct amount of load to be shed. The performance of the proposed controller has been validated using computer simulations of the actual distribution network in Malaysia. These simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed centralized controller for preventing power system instabilities, which might lead to cascading outages and even a complete blackout in microgrids that have been disconnected/islanded, from the main grid. © 1986-2012 IEEE.},

The existing power grid model does not provide real-time information of transmission devices, security during emergency events, and frequency and voltage control. The proposed scheme consists of location-centric hybrid system architecture for the coordinated processing among proximate devices. The neighboring devices follow a collaboration algorithm to handle faulty and incomplete information. The proposed scheme also consists of distributed algorithm for the maintenance of the local state of the smart grid and a real-time accessibility control of transmission devices. The security of the system can be guaranteed by reconfiguration through power-electronics and switches. An embedded intelligence is inserted into the power-electronics to facilitate the reconfiguration of the system, and thereby ensuring security. A generalized optimization formulation determines the optimum location of the transmission devices. In this paper, Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to handle the reactive power management. The use of GA decreases execution time of resource scheduling.

There are different estimation techniques in the specialized bibliography, so the selection for their implementation involves analyzing a trade-off of operating characteristics such as accuracy, response time or complexity. This paper proposes a three-phase estimation algorithm with high fidelity performance during abnormal grid conditions. The proposed algorithm combines a new Two-Sample Sequence Extractor (TSSE) and a Recursive Least Mean Square (RLMS) frequency estimator in a mutual feedback mode to improve its operation. To estimate the amplitude and phase of the positive and negative sequence components, the TSSE performs a linear approximation between two voltage samples. Furthermore, a slide window approach RLMS is used to estimate the system's frequency. Simulation and experimental results are presented to analyze and validate the performance of the TSSE-RLMS. In addition, the proposed algorithm is compared with other four kinds of estimation methods under different grid conditions. © 2024 The Authors},

However, the performance is deteriorated due to the influence of uncertainties and disturbances, e.g., periodic input voltage and load variation. Concerning this problem, this article proposes a model-free control (MFC) strategy of single-phase ac/dc converters. The MFC principle is revisited and a frequency response analysis is presented for the algebraic estimators of uncertainties and disturbances. Consequently, the closed-loop performance of MFC systems is allowed to be analyzed in frequency domain via classical linear control theory. Based on the theoretical results, the model-free current and voltage control systems are synthesized in detail to achieve control objectives of the converter. Simulation results demonstrate the performance of MFC systems in reference tracking and disturbance rejection. The feasibility and validity of the presented MFC strategy for single-phase boost ac/dc converters is also confirmed experimentally as compared to the benchmark scheme.  © 1986-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Motivated by the increasing need for robust and accurate assessment of the electrical distribution system, a developed foretaste aided state estimator is proposed. Moreover, due to the lack of measurements in the electrical distribution system, the pseudo-measurements are needed to insure the observability of the state estimator. Therefore, the very short term load forecasting algorithm that insures the observability and provides reliable backup data in case of sensor malfunction or communication failure is proposed. The proposed very short term load forecasting is based on the wavelet recurrent neural network (WRNN). The historical data used to train the RNN are decomposed into low-frequency, low-high frequency and high frequency components. The neural networks are trained using an extended Kalman filter (EKF) for the low frequency component and using a square root cubature Kalman filter (SCKF) for both low-high frequency and high frequency components. To estimate the system states, state estimation algorithm based SCKF is used. The results demonstrate the theoretical and practical advantages of the proposed methodology. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces an approach to near timeoptimal control for synchronous buck dc-dc converters. The proposed proximate time-optimal digital (PTOD) controller is a combination of a constant-frequency pulsewidth modulation (PWM) controller employing a linear PID compensator close to a reference point, and a linear or nonlinear switching surface controller (SSC) away from the reference, together with smooth transitions between the two. A hybrid capacitor current estimator enables switching surface evaluation and eliminates the need for current sensing. The SSC, which is implemented as a small Verilog HDL module, can be easily added to an existing digital PWM controller to construct the PTOD controller. In steady state, the controller operates exactly the same as a standard constant-frequency PWM controller with a linear PID compensator.

	abstract = {To reduce the adverse influence of communication time delay, the DC voltage of offshore converters is usually employed as input signals of existing communication-free frequency support schemes of offshore wind farms (OWFs). However, the offshore DC voltage varies with the output power of OWFs, this distortion will deteriorate the frequency support performance. To address this issue, an improved communication-free coordinated control (ICFCC) scheme of VSC-MTDC integrated OWFs for frequency support is proposed. The ICFCC scheme involves the onshore frequency variation into the DC voltage deviation once frequency events occur, and an estimator is proposed to obtain the onshore DC voltage in offshore VSC stations to provide fast frequency support and reduce the distortion influence. Meanwhile, to obtain better support performance, the frequency support power is allocated reasonably by regulating droop coefficients adaptively, more power will be injected via the station closer to the disturbing bus. After frequency support, the offshore wind turbines will recover their rotor speed with asymptotic control to reduce second frequency drop. Case studies are carried out on the 4-terminal and 5-terminal test systems, respectively, while considering the parameter uncertainties and noise disturbance. Different control methods are compared to illustrate the effectiveness of the ICFCC scheme. IEEE},

The proposed scheme relies on a high-bandwidth current-control loop, which is designed with continuous wideband active damping against converter-grid disturbances and parametric uncertainties by providing adaptive internal-model dynamics. First, a predictive current controller with time-delay compensation is adopted to control the grid-side current with high-bandwidth characteristics to facilitate higher bandwidth disturbance rejection and active-damping control at higher frequencies. Second, to ensure high disturbance rejection of grid distortion, converter resonance at parameter variation, and parametric instabilities, an adaptive internal model for the capacitor voltage and grid-side current dynamics is included within the current-feedback structure. Due to the time-varying and periodic nature of the internal-model dynamics, a neural-network-based estimator is proposed to construct the internal-model dynamics in real time. Theoretical analysis and comparative experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme. © 2010 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Accurate information about generator rotor speeds and angles plays an important role for power system transient stability online assessment and protection. To address this need, this paper proposes a fast and robust estimation approach based on the model transformation strategy. Thanks to this strategy, the original complex nonlinear model is transformed into a linear one without linerization, which makes the dynamical system observability analysis and the estimation problem significantly easier to solve. The proposed model transformation strategy is achieved by taking the measured generator active power as the input variable and the derived frequency and the rate of change of frequency measurements from the phasor measurement units (PMUs) as the output variables of the dynamical generator model. This allows us to estimate the generator rotor speeds and angles using only local PMU measurements and the swing equations, relaxing the need of a detailed generator model on which the existing dynamic state estimators are based. A robust Kalman filter is also developed to handle data quality problems as the frequency and rate of change of frequency measurements can be biased in presence of severe disturbance or communication issues. Comparison results carried out on the IEEE 39-bus system successfully validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach under various conditions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

In this study, Equilibrium Optimizer (EO) based harmonic estimator has been proposed and applied to solve the harmonic and sub/inter-harmonic estimation problems. In addition to estimation amplitude, phase and frequency, unlike the literature, DC offset decaying values of power signals have been estimated with proposed method. Most common used synthetic stationary signals and dynamic signal with different noisy levels have been used in order to shown effectiveness. From the outputs, it has been seen that the proposed method gives high resolution results and has an impressive performance even if the parameters of the harmonics increase and/or the harmonics have high SNR levels. Moreover, obtained results indicate the EO-based estimator can robustly and accurately estimate all unknown or specified parameters of the harmonics simultaneously with high accuracy and higher resolution. © 2024},

	abstract = {Monitoring the voltage frequency is of great significance in power systems. In this paper we propose two novel frequency estimators, namely the unbalanced HAM-WLS (UHW) estimator and the weighted least squares fusion (WLSF) estimator, to identify the voltage frequency in unbalanced three-phase power systems. The UHW method modifies both the coarse search and the weighted least squares (WLS) post-processing step of our previous HAM-WLS algorithm, and thus removes the spectrum leakage caused by the fluctuant maxima of the signal periodogram in phase unbalanced grids. Meanwhile, a new alternative is used in the WLSF estimator to aggregate the signal information in three difference phases. Compared with the Clarke's transformation that merely maximizes signal to noise ratios (SNRs), the proposed WLSF assigns different weights to the single-phase estimates according to their estimation variances, leading to improved accuracy and higher reliability. Both proposed estimation algorithms employ the Fourier coefficient interpolation and the iterative leakage subtraction in the frequency domain to lower the computation complexity as well as the WLS technique as a post-processing step to enhance the estimation precision. Therefore, both estimators realize accurate estimates with low computational cost. The complexity calculation, simulations and experiments for various scenarios all support the analysis. The results also show that the WLSF estimator exhibits more precise and stable performance than the UHW estimator at the cost of requiring relatively higher computational effort. © 1986-2012 IEEE.},

Loads are traditionally used as pseudo measurements to fill in for unavailable real-time analog telemetry in order to provide required observability for state estimator to solve. The quality of load model also directly impacts the quality of state estimator and power flow solution. There are several important factors to consider when modeling for real-time applications in EMS. Those include (i) the granularity of load model i.e. whether loads are lumped for the entre station bus or each individual feeder in a substation is represented as a separate load, (ii) load voltage sensitivity which describes the variations of real and reactive loads with changes of bus voltage, (iii) load frequency sensitivity which emulates impacts of frequency deviations on loads and (iv) load accuracy model that assigns accuracy class to loads to be used by state estimator. In addition, the aspects of load model such as load allocation in real-time as well as modeling of loads in the external system also need to be addressed. The objective of this paper is to discuss the load model that BC Hydro has implemented in the network model in EMS to support the state estimator and other EMS advanced applications in real-time. © 2012 IEEE.},

The new formulation takes into account the fact that minor degree of imbalance in the system is acceptable and does not indicate subsequent interruptions, failures, or degradation of physical components. A generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) is developed and shown to be a function of the negative-sequence phasor estimator and the acceptable level of imbalances for nominal system operations. As a by-product to the proposed detection method, a constrained estimation of the positive and negative phasors and the frequency deviation is obtained for both balanced and unbalanced situations. The theoretical and numerical performance analyses show improved performance over benchmark techniques and robustness to the presence of additional harmonics. © 2014 IEEE.},

The proposed dynamic estimators estimate amplitudes and phase angles of the current injected by the grid at the point of common coupling with the distributed generation (DG) in addition to the DG's bus voltage. A distributed two-level algorithm is proposed to detect an islanding condition for single and multi-DG configurations. Analytical design and transient analysis are carried out for the islanding detection problem to determine the nondetection zone (NDZ) of the proposed islanding detection algorithm. A local low-frequency meshed communication network is sufficient to achieve distributed islanding detection capability for a general multi-DG network with negligible NDZ. It is shown through simulations that the proposed IDM can successfully distinguish an islanding condition from other disturbances that may occur in power system networks. © 2014 IEEE.},

We propose new algorithms to identify and localize imbalances occurring at any location in the power grid, based only on single-phase PMU data. First, we develop a technique using the minimum description length (MDL) criterion that is carried out at the control center. The centralized MDL methodology is time consuming and has computational complexity that grows exponentially with the network size. Therefore, we next develop a projected orthogonal matching pursuit (POMP) algorithm, which is a low-complexity method for bus imbalance identification in large-scale power networks implemented at the control center. POMP is a computationally efficient compressive sensing technique that exploits the sparse structure of the voltage measurements. The proposed methods are validated through three case studies: A two-port \pi-model, an IEEE-14 bus system, and an IEEE 118-bus system. Simulations show that our networked algorithms, MDL and POMP, obtain improved performance over local bus-level identification techniques. The performance of POMP is close to that of centralized MDL, with the advantage of being applicable to large-scale networks. © 1969-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) are essential for real-time power system monitoring and control. In this paper, a novel algorithm for protection (i.e., P Class) PMUs is presented. The proposed algorithm consists of four steps: preliminary narrowband disturbance whitening; estimation of the off-nominal fundamental frequency offset through the Interpolated Discrete Time Fourier Transform (IpDFT); data record length adjustment to refine narrowband disturbance whitening over an integer number of fundamental periods; time-domain estimation of the Taylor's series coefficients of the synchrophasor function through a weighted least-squares estimator (after correction of possible static off-nominal deviations). The key novel contribution of the proposed approach is its superior ability to smooth harmonic disturbances over shorter observation intervals than many existing algorithms (which typically require at least two-cycle-long data records to meet P Class accuracy requirements), while ensuring a good tracking capability of transient events with a reasonable execution time. Several simulation and experimental results confirm that, in the case of multi-harmonic distortion, the proposed approach returns more accurate results than both the basic Taylor-series-based Weighted Least-Squares (TWLS) estimator and other whitening-based techniques, while ensuring compliance with P Class specifications even over one-cycle-long data records. © 2024 The Author(s)},

However, complicated dynamic frequency interaction, active power oscillation, and inappropriate transient active power-sharing will occur when VSGs are widely applied. Center of Inertia (COI) is introduced for solving these problems. But the calculation of COI frequency relies on global communication and a centralized controller, which results in high communication costs and complexity, and reduces the system reliability. This paper proposes a distributed control method via COI frequency for multi-VSG grids. The COI frequency estimator is designed based on dynamic consensus control. Communication between adjacent neighbors is required, which improves reliability and reduces communication costs. The stability of the proposed control method is proved and the feasible range of the control parameter is presented in this paper. Simulations and experiments are carried out to verify the effectiveness and feasibility. © 2022},

The DFIG-dc system uses a diode bridge rectifier between the stator winding of DFIG and dc link. A reduced-power three-phase pulsewidth modulation converter is connected between the rotor winding of DFIG and dc link. Due to the diode commutation, the stator current and stator flux linkage are distorted with harmonics. To reduce the resulting torque ripple, the rotor currents need to track a pulsating reference signal to compensate the distortion of the stator flux. To improve the current tracking performance, MRF-based estimators are used to calculate the main harmonics in both the command value and actual value of the rotor current. Then, an MRF-based regulator is implemented to achieve an accurate tracking for the harmonics of the rotor current command. Both simulation and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in reducing the torque ripple. The robustness of the proposed algorithm against deviation of stator frequency is also supported by the simulation and experimental results. © 1986-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The phasor estimation process is important in monitoring, controlling and protecting power networks. Prony’s method can be used as an estimator by which electrical power system parameters are approximated. The Prony algorithm is challenging under noise conditions due to its frequency-adaptive parameter estimations. Joining several channels of PMUs was suggested recently in the literature as a way to counter this. However, implementing this comes at the expense of a considerable increase in the computational burden and thereby its applicability is restricted in real-time applications. A recursive multi-channel Prony technique is presented in this paper where several channels are used to estimate the phasor of one variable (voltage/current) accurately and efficiently. The proposed method speeds up the phasor estimation process by utilising the previous estimates. Various requirements presented in IEEE standard C37.118.1 are employed to assess the performance of the proposed method in different conditions. Finally, the proposed method is examined by two real-world data-sets: Measured current from a Mexican power system, processed offline in MATLAB, and measured voltage from National Instrument devices, processed online in LABVIEW. The proposed method performs efficiently for both the synthesised and real data. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The diffusion of nonlinear loads and power electronic devices in power systems deteriorates the signal environment, and increases the difficulty of measuring harmonic phasors. Considering accurate harmonic phasor information is necessary to deal with harmonic related issues, this paper focuses on realizing accurate dynamic harmonic phasor estimation when the signal is contaminated by certain interharmonic tones, i.e. the out-of-band interference (OBI). Specifically, this work introduces the singular value decomposition into the Taylor-Fourier transform algorithm, deriving a general decomposition form for harmonic phasor filters, and yielding a set of adjustable parameters. Then these parameters are configured to minimize the negative influence of OBI on the dynamic harmonic phasor filters. Based on the recommended parameter values, the optimized harmonic estimator is obtained, and then tested under signals distorted by OBI, harmonic, noise, and in worse cases, frequency deviation, and some dynamic conditions. Test results show the proposal achieves good harmonic phasor estimation even under multiple interferences and dynamic scenarios, and has a much weaker dependence on OBI tones compared to conventional approaches.  © 1986-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The phasor measurement unit (PMU) commonly implements enhanced discrete Fourier transformation (EDFT) to compensate leakage and signal discontinuity errors at offnominal frequencies. However, EDFT results in a high total vector error (TVE) at large offnominal frequency and worsens with harmonics in power signals. Although the sample value adjustment (SVA) technique addressed such demerits, it generates an asymmetrical TVE profile. In addition, the frequency estimator was not taken into account in the previous publication on SVA. This paper proposes an improved sample value adjustment (ISVA) as a pre-DFT technique to further enhance the phasor estimation. The ISVA generates a symmetrical TVE profile and performed better than EDFT, SVA, and Taylor weighted least-square method at steady-state conditions. Subsequently, the ISVA is integrated with a recursive least-square frequency estimator, which enabled it to track dynamic signals as well. The algorithm is validated in MATLAB simulation and in a prototyped PMU. Static and dynamic test signals are based on the IEEE C37.118.1a-2014 standard. © 1986-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Critical conduction mode (CRM) is widely used in totem-pole Boost power factor correction converters due to its compatibility with soft-switching and high switching frequency. Conventionally, a current sensor or zero-current detector is required to realize CRM operation. The system performances highly rely on the behaviors of peripheral circuits. Additional power loss and delay are also introduced. Moreover, the inductor current contains obvious differential mode noise, which brings interferences to the sensing signals. To address this issue, a novel CRM realization method is proposed. It utilizes an inductor current estimator model to estimate the averaged current and to predict the current zero crossings. The noisy sensing signal is replaced by estimated values. Therefore, the zero-current detection circuit is removed, which simplifies the peripheral circuit design. Valley switching and zero-voltage switching can also be achieved. Operation principles, digital implementation, and error suppression of the proposed control are analyzed. The proposed concepts are validated on a 550-W, 150kHz-1.6MHz, GaN-based prototype. Experimental results record 98.96% peak efficiency with a 0.9972 power factor.  © 1986-2012 IEEE.},

The inertia value can be accurately extracted for areas of different compositions with different penetrations of converter-interfaced generators. Firstly, the internal frequency variation of the generator units is computed by means of a frequency divider-based estimator. Subsequently, these internal frequency variations are used to carry out a generator clustering, which provides groups of coherent generators to the proposed inertia estimator. Finally, the iterative EE SI approach provides a joint inertia estimation for each of these coherent groups. Numerical results on a properly modified version of both the IEEE 39-bus and the IEEE 118-bus test systems highlight the accuracy of the proposed method using both ambient measurements and ringdown signal measurements (power imbalance events). Furthermore, the proposed method presents a low computational burden that allows fast estimation updating times. IEEE},

A two-level control structure is developed, including 1) the central-level grid-side inductor current control and zero-sequence voltage control; and 2) the local-level per-phase power module control of VF-CSS model predictive controller with state estimator. Two VF-CSS controllers are proposed, including variable-continuous-frequency critical-soft-switching controller and variable-discrete-frequency critical-soft-switching, to achieve critical soft-switching operation for high efficiency. The combination of MPC and VF-CSS guarantees a complete critical soft-switching operation at full period range of varying frequency and especially during transient. The state estimator provides sampling noise rejection and accurate switch-side inductor current estimations for MPC and VF-CSS. Also, with the help of state estimator, the current sensor cost is reduced by 50%. Meanwhile, the estimator contributes to a more accurate switch-side inductor current reading for MPC implementation with variable continuous frequency controller, especially when the critical soft switching requires huge inductor current ripple. With the proposed control strategies and topology, medium-frequency (> 200 kHz, 45 μ H) and high-frequency (> 1 MHz, 4.5 μ H) test benches are validated experimentally.

	abstract = {A constrained predictive speed controller with an input current limit and a constrained predictive current controller (CPCC) with an input voltage limit are proposed for high-performance sensorless interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM) drive systems. Recent predictive controllers for sensorless IPMSM drives tend to focus on unconstrained predictive controllers, which do not consider the voltage or current limitations of inverters and may cause responses that are not smooth. The proposed constrained predictive controllers in this article solve these problems by imposing constraints in the performance index for real-time optimization. Simplified numerical solutions that use Hildreth quadratic programming are used to identify active constraints, and then the control inputs are limited within their physical ranges. In addition, a simple external load estimator based on the Lyapunov function is designed to compensate for external load disturbances. Moreover, a current-slope-based rotor position estimation method, which does not require any extra hardware or high-frequency signal generators or occupy any dc-link voltage, is implemented to accurately estimate the rotor position and speed. The proposed method in this article improves the dynamic performance and reduces computational complexity when implemented in sensorless IPMSM drive systems. The proposed methods have quick transient responses, excellent load disturbance responses, good tracking capabilities, and good robustness. The sensorless IPMSM drive system proposed in this article is operated at full-range speeds, from 1 to 3000 r/min. Several simulations and experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed constrained predictive controllers.  © 1986-2012 IEEE.},

A further challenge comes from strict regulatory constraints that stipulate low transmission power. In this paper, we propose an adaptive robust turbo equalizer for single-carrier coded systems. The turbo equalizer has a component equalizer to deal with the deep frequency notches present in power-line channels. The component equalizer exchanges extrinsic information with a component decoder to perform iterative detection. To facilitate adaptive equalization in time-varying power-line channels, a simple system identification-based channel estimator is incorporated. Most important, a nonlinear-matched myriad filter (MMyF) is used for efficient baseband filtering in impulsive channels. The results show that the MMyF is indispensable for the turbo equalizer to achieve reliable channel estimation and data detection in impulsive power lines. Substantial performance improvements over the conventional scheme designed for Gaussian channels are observed. © 2007 IEEE.},

The filter bank is composed of bandpass filters. The initial center frequency of each filter is purposely chosen to be equal to harmonic frequencies. However, an adaptation strategy makes it possible to track time-varying frequencies as well as interharmonic components. A downsampler device follows the filtering stage, reducing the computational burden, especially because undersampling operations are performed.

In addition, signals distorted by noises, harmonics and inter-harmonics were also tested.

	abstract = {It is well known in the power system community that frequency is not a global variable during transients. The previously proposed frequency divider (FD) is a valid approach to estimate load bus frequencies in large transmission networks wherein the load dynamics are typically ignored. In converter-driven grids, load dynamics may have a significant impact on the local frequency dynamics. This article determines that the FD has low accuracy under such conditions. This paper proposes a centralized dynamic phasor estimator (DPE) to track the frequency of the load buses and additionally estimate the branch current phasors and load bus voltage phasors. The key idea is to formulate the power system state-space model in the dynamic phasor domain such that grid-forming converter (GFC) bus voltage phasors and load power measurements are inputs and the load bus voltage and branch current phasors as states. The dynamic phasor of the GFC bus voltage is calculated by measuring the terminal voltage of the GFC bus and the internal frequency available within the droop-control loop of the GFC. A complex-PLL (C-PLL) is proposed to track the rotation of the load bus voltage phasors to estimate the actual frequency at the load buses. Numerical simulations are carried out on the modified WSCC 9-bus system and the IEEE 39-bus system to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 1969-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a novel application for the optimal Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) servo controller to enable a proper coordination of the AC/HVDC interconnected system with Virtual Synchronous Power (VSP) based inertia emulation. Particularly, the proposed control design takes the process disturbances and measurement noise of the studied VSP-HVDC system into account, while few studies have focused on this perspective. The proposed LQG controller with modifications is designed by means of a combination of Kalman Filter (state estimator) and an added Linear Quadratic Integrator (LQI) to observe the system model's states and track the reference commands while rejecting the effects of system noise. Besides, we utilize a swarm-based optimization algorithm to operate as the search process for the tuning of the elements in the weighting matrices involved in the controller design. The role of the proposed optimal LQG controller is to stabilize such AC/DC interconnected system with VSP-based inertia emulator while minimizing the associated performance index. According to the obtained simulation results, in addition to the advancement from the VSP-based approach for damping frequency oscillations excited by faults, application of the proposed LQG servo controller can achieve the targets on both estimating the state variables and tracking the reference signals with satisfactory performance, comparing with the conventional LQG regulator. © 2021 The Author(s)},

This approach generally improves the algorithm performance: immunity to random noise, accuracy, and the speed of convergence. The IRNTA considers the power frequency as an unknown model parameter and takes into account distortion of voltages and currents. Therefore, it is suitable for the real-time PQ monitoring. The algorithm has two stages. In the first stage, the input signal spectra and fundamental frequency are estimated, whereas in the second stage, the unknown PQ indices are calculated.

It can be applied when the system is under normal operating conditions or after power imbalance events. The algorithm is based on a recursive system identification approach and uses the active power and bus frequency measurements proceeding from phasor measurement units. The measurements are preprocessed to improve the estimation accuracy. Subsequently, a model-independent rotor speed estimator is used to compute rotor speed variations (or internal frequency variations, in the case of CIGs). Afterwards, a recursive least-square equation error formulation is implemented to compute the SG and CIG parameters in the z-domain, which are later converted into their respective counterparts in the s-domain. The method is applied to several generation devices in the IEEE 39-bus and IEEE 118-bus test systems, including traditional SGs and CIGs providing virtual inertia. Numerical results show the accuracy and the low computational burden of the proposed method. © 2023 The Author(s)},

Recently, a modified demodulation-based technique (MDT) has been presented, which aims to accurately extract the grid voltage fundamental parameters under harmonically distorted and frequency-varying conditions. In this letter, it is shown that the MDT is actually a phase-locked loop.

In this paper, in order to make the PV systems provide multi-time scale frequency response, a novel distributed event-triggered hierarchical control (DEHC) of PV inverters is proposed, which includes a primary frequency response (PFR) control loop and a secondary frequency response (SFR) control loop. For the PFR, the PV inverters that operate in frequency regulation (FR) mode can arrest the frequency deviation in sub-seconds time-scale by an automatic deloading strategy, which is with low cost and easy to implement as no requirements for a storage system, irradiance sensors, and MPP estimators. For the SFR, the PV inverters that operate in FR mode can respond to the reference instruction assigned by a high-level AGC control center in seconds time-scale based on a novel distributed control strategy, which can converge within a fixed-time that independents to the initial conditions of the system. Furthermore, a novel event-triggered mechanism is designed to reduce the communication costs between PV inverters. Finally, case study results verify the effectiveness and improved performance of the proposed method. © 1969-2012 IEEE.},

The operating point changes significantly during such transient events; consequently the estimation method should adapt to the time-varying nature of the AFRC. Moreover, available measurements have a poor time resolution and are considerably contaminated by errors. Therefore, new estimation methods are proposed that are based on local correlation between the frequency deviation and interchange power variation measured on all area's tie-lines. The presented estimation methods were compared with a classical approach that is based on the ratio of mean changes as well as with conventional least squares parameter estimators.

	abstract = {A second-order generalized integrator (SOGI) is a resonant regulator with a pair of complex-conjugate poles, and therefore, with infinite magnitude at its center frequency. Thanks to this property, one can put together a set of m SOGIs in an elegant way and decompose a single-phase signal into its constituent frequency components and detect their amplitude and phase angle. Such a configuration, which is often referred to as the multi-SOGI (MSOGI) structure, requires a frequency estimator to adapt the center frequency of SOGIs to frequency changes. This frequency estimation is often provided by interconnecting the MSOGI structure with a basic frequency-locked loop (FLL) or phase-locked loop (PLL). The resulting structures are known as the MSOGI-FLL and MSOGI-PLL. These structures and their close variants are mathematically difficult to analyze probably because of the lack of a linear model for these systems. This article aims to bridge this research gap. First, it is shown how linear time-periodic (LTP) models of the MSOGI-FLL and MSOGI-PLL can be obtained. The model verification, obtaining open-loop harmonic transfer function from the LTP model, and LTP stability assessment of MSOGI-based synchronization systems are the next parts of this article.

	abstract = {Accurate and near real-time estimates of electromechanical modes are of great importance since the modal damping is a key indicator of the stability of the power system. If the estimates of the electromechanical modes are to be useful, knowing the variability in the estimates is critically important. This paper presents a method of directly estimating the variance of each mode estimate in addition to estimating the frequency and damping of each mode in an online setting using a recursive maximum likelihood (RML) estimator. The variance estimates are achieved using two closed-form multidimensional Taylor series approximations, the details of which are fully derived here. The proposed method is validated using a Monte Carlo simulation with a low order model of the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) power system under both ambient and probing conditions, with multiple modes closely spaced in frequency, and is compared to the regularized robust recursive least squares (R3LS) method. It is also successfully applied to phasor measurement unit (PMU) data collected from the actual WECC system, also under both ambient and probing conditions. © 1969-2012 IEEE.},

CAISO simulations of the market redesign are a unique opportunity to compare a) estimated LMPs if the redesign were in place during recent historical periods with b) actual conditions, as logged in operating records. The study uses market schedules and bids in an Alternating Current Optimal Power Flow simulation. Resulting LMPs are similar within current congestion zones, but price differences occur during high loads, reflecting actual changes in system conditions. The frequency and magnitude of LMP differences are consistent with the current market, suggesting that the increased market transparency will produce stable, predictable prices.

	abstract = {The main purpose of this article is to demonstrate the grid support capability of variable speed hydropower (VSHP). The hypothesis is that active power control of VSHP plants can improve both the frequency stability and the transient rotor angle stability by contributing to virtual inertia (VI), fast frequency reserves and power oscillation damping. Fast active power control is made possible by power electronic converters obtaining the energy from the rotating masses of the turbine and generator while the rotational speed is restored by control of the guide vane opening of the hydro turbine. A detailed dynamic simulation model is developed to simulate the VSHP within the Nordic 44-bus grid model. The VSHP controller includes a moving horizon estimator (MHE), model predictive control (MPC) with inertia emulation realised by the frequency converter of the VSHP plant. The results show that VSHP can contribute significantly to reduce the maximum frequency deviation following a sudden loss of generation. In addition, the amplitudes of power oscillations are reduced and the critical fault clearing times are generally improved. The VSHP should, therefore, be regarded as one of the technically viable options for provision of fast balancing system services. © 1969-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Small signal stability is a crucial aspect of accurately keeping control in modern interconnected power systems, in order to ensure the required security and reliability standards. Such an aspect could represent a serious limiting factor in the search for ever higher power system exploitation levels. Hence, in order to exploit the existing networks as much as possible, ensuring at the same time adequate security levels, the system operators must monitor the electromechanical oscillations continuously, estimating their fundamental parameters (e.g. frequency, damping factor/ratio, amplitude and phase), and determining the actual dynamic stability margins. Nowadays, electromechanical oscillations tracking can be performed in real time thanks to the quick development of wide area measurement/monitoring systems, and the employment of so-called measurement-based methods (a.k.a. mode meters). In this regard, the paper presents a performance comparison among several measurement-based methods currently operating on the Italian Wide Area Monitoring (WAM) platform. The main objective of this investigation is to analyze the behavior of each of them with respect to actual critical/not critical electromechanical oscillations recorded on the European Network Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-e) Continental Synchronous European System (CESA). The considered case studies cover a large variety of situations that can be encountered in the ordinary ENTSO-e CESA operation: local and inter-area oscillations; single mode and multi-mode power signals; ambient and ringdown data; and so on. By keeping in mind that usually no best estimator exists, owing to the lack of an optimality definition, the present analysis aims at examining whether some algorithms are generally more suitable than others, with respect to the variety of aforementioned situations. In detail, the measurement-based methods considered in this work are the Tufts-Kumaresan method, Hankel Singular Value Decomposition-VarPRO, Hilbert-Huang Transform, its refined Empirical Mode Decomposition with Fourier-Based Masking Technique (R-EMD), and a recently published Hilbert Transform-based estimation algorithm. Obviously, this set of estimation techniques cannot be considered exhaustive for the research problem under analysis. Nonetheless, it represents a collection of the major, recent and most fashionable methodologies implemented in actual WAM architectures. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a network tracking estimator using Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) and legacy measurements. It proposes a new solution for handling PMUs with different data reporting rates. This is achieved by including the center (average or center-of-inertia) frequency as a state variable to align the PMU measurements at the estimation time. The weighted least squares estimation is formulated in complex variables via Wirtinger calculus so that the implementation can exploit Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) extensions. It, therefore, allows tracking mode operation commensurate with real-time computing requirements. In addition to the conventional measurement functions, the proposed model includes new procedures for estimating the center frequency, aligning the measurements in time, and rotating phasors to initialize the tracking solution. The effect of the proposed formulation on the tracking estimator&#x0027;s performance metrics is evaluated on networks with up to 1888 nodes under transient conditions. The results show that properly accounting for time skew in synchrophasor data can improve the percentage error by up to four times while remaining within a 40-ms time window in successive estimation tracking.

	abstract = {Autonomous, self-governing micro energy networks are a smart energy solution that satisfy the energy needs of isolated communities. Such smart micro networks usually comprise of several distributed semi-controllable power resources, storages and loads. Usually, the power generation sources draw their energy from renewable energy resources. Power electronics converters suitably condition the power to be transmitted and utilized. A sensory, control and communication layer ensures the integration of several network components to achieve stable network operation. Distributed power-sharing methods function at local processing and decision-making nodes across the energy network. The complete control scheme is a hierarchical structure divided into four control levels. Faults and latencies experienced at the communication network layer adversely affect the performance of the control scheme. This paper proposes a new and improved hierarchical, multi-agents-based control strategy for efficient power-sharing, voltage and frequency regulation between nodes during communication link latencies. A novel distributed averaging estimator is proposed to estimate power injected in the system at various nodes and thereby mitigate the effect of relayed information delays. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is established comprehensively through mathematical modeling, analytical proofs, discrete-time small signal stability analysis, and MATLAB case study simulations. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

It follows the active methodology, in which an intermittent noncharacteristic signal is injected into the dc-link to estimate the equivalent series resistance (ESR) and capacitance (C) of dc-link capacitors. A real-time stationary discrete wavelet packet transform (RT-SDWPT) performs the capacitor parameter estimations. In this scheme, an interharmonic is used as a noncharacteristic signal to prevent the influence of the system's inherent harmonic components, mitigating estimation errors. Moreover, the interharmonic frequency is chosen in the region influenced by the ESR and C parameters to ensure capacitor degradation condition. Besides, to mitigate quality issues, the interharmonic's amplitude, duration, and the time interval between two signal injections follow the recommendations defined by standards. Furthermore, a parameter deviation detection scheme is employed to adaptively adjust the time interval between two estimations, improving failure detection. Experimental results obtained from a microgrid laboratory setup demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This paper proposes an online decentralized and data-driven method for synchronous generator rotor speed and inertia estimation. First, an analytical relationship between the generator terminal voltage/current phasors and its internal rotor speed is derived using the Thevenin equivalent. The parameters of the latter are obtained via a recursive estimator, which allows us to estimate the generator's internal rotor speed from voltage/current phasors without the need for any generator information. Second, we reformulate the equivalent swing equation into the Kalman filter form, which enables us to use a priori-estimated internal rotor speed along with measured real and reactive power injections to obtain an estimate of the inertia for each online synchronous generator. This is achieved through an adaptive unscented Kalman filter. We demonstrate that the use of terminal bus frequency to approximate the rotor speed for inertia estimation by existing methods leads to large estimation biases/errors. Numerical simulations carried out on the IEEE 39-bus and Texas 2000-bus systems reveal that our proposed method is consistently more accurate than existing methods. Moreover, our proposed method is insensitive to both the type and location of system disturbances, and it is robust to different levels of measurement noise. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

Since it is impossible to measure the sag level at every node of a distribution feeder, estimation of sag characteristics at unmetered nodes becomes necessary. This paper proposes the concept of "voltage sag state estimation" and associated algorithms to achieve this goal. The proposed method has the following characteristics: 1) It makes use of the radial connection characteristic of a distribution feeder, 2) it is based on a limited number of metering points, and 3) it employs a least-square method to predict the sag profile along a distribution line. The results of the proposed sag state estimator can be used to calculate the feeder power quality performance indices such as the System Average RMS Frequency Index (SARFIx). © 2005 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a method for frequency estimation in power system by demodulation of two complex signals. In power system analysis, the αβ-transform is used to convert three phase quantities to a complex quantity where the real part is the in-phase component and the imaginary part is the quadrature component. This complex signal is demodulated with a known complex phasor rotating in opposite direction to the input. The advantage of this method is that the demodulation does not introduce a double frequency component. For signals with high signal to noise ratio, the filtering demand for the double frequency component can often limit the speed of the frequency estimator. Hence, the method can improve fast frequency estimation of signals with good noise properties. The method looses its benefits for noisy signals, where the filter design is governed by the demand to filter harmonics and white noise. The method has been previously published, but not explored to its potential. The paper presents four examples to illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of the method. © 1996 IEEE.},

In the construction of regression equations explaining the hourly load/weather relationships, most modeling efforts have not been theoretically acceptable because the error terms of these models are not expected to be random and uncorrelated. This paper describes an alternative statistical approach that will produce efficient estimators in the presence of complex serial correlation in the model's error structure. Hannan's Efficient Estimator, a form of frequency domain regression analysis, was used to develop efficient hourly load/weather equations. From the normalized hourly load database, monthly peaks were extracted. Box-Jenkins (B-J) analysis was performed on these monthly peaks for production of 24-month intermediate-term forecasts. The results of these forecasts were compared with B-J forecasts prepared from actual monthly peaks. Of the 12 forecasts compared, the average monthly error for 11 was reduced by 50 percent or more. For 9 of these forecasts, the error reduction was 66 percent or more. © 1988 IEEE},

An electric power network may be subject to harmonic injection due to the presence of nonlinear loads or sources (e.g., rectifiers, inverters). Methods have been reported elsewhere to analyze the propagation of these harmonic signals throughout the network. In this paper, the reverse problem is considered: how does one identify the source (and potentially the type) of harmonic signals. Line and bus data at several points in the network are used with a least squares estimator to calculate the injection spectrum at busses suspected of being harmonic sources. When energy at harmonic frequencies is found to be injected into the network at a bus, that bus is identified as a harmonic source. © 1989 IEEE},

The first part of the study is an assessment of active transmission loss savings obtained by optimizing generator voltages and transformer taps with an Optimal Power Flow program using data from a state estimator. In the second part of the study, the question is addressed of how frequently the generator voltages and transformer taps should be optimized in order to achieve a large percentage of the loss savings identified in the first part. The study showed that the reduction in active losses is sufficient to justify further effort toward implementing voltage control. The results of the second part showed that for the load curve studied, most of the savings could be achieved with voltage control cycle times of about one hour. A new quadratic programing-based optimal power flow algorithm is also presented which exhibits execution times suitable for real-time applications. Sample execution times are given for various systems which confirm that exact optimal power flow solutions can be obtained in a fraction of the control cycle times suggested in the second part of the study.

Different factors affecting the identification process such as data window size, sampling frequency and number of samples are studied. Effects of bad data on the solution accuracy are also studied. The speed of convergence is examined by changing the estimator initial conditions. The results obtained show that the proposed technique can estimate and track the symmetrical components of non-stationary three-phase unbalance voltage or current waveforms in noisy environments.
